## Prologue
The tides of fortune having washed us ashore one day in the Vallée de Chevreuse, on the startling banks of the Institut des Hautes Études Scientifiques (IHES), like the shipwrecked sailors in the travels of Sinbad, we were astounded by the customs of the inhabitants of this uncharted island. An instinctive reflex prompted us to take photographs of them, in their lonely offices, or attempting to scale the north face of the triptych boards of the lecture halls, chalk or pencil in hand, engrossed in dialogues, drinking with their eyes each other’s words.
One of them, not the least among them, seeing these photos, thought that “if everyone wrote a little text” we could make a book out of it. To our wonder, everyone played the game. The texts arrived like autumn leaves, short, immense, violent, delicate, allusive, direct.... A whole human society with its essential fragility, composed of mathematicians, theoretical physicists, biologists, permanent residents or those just passing through, post grads or prize-winning researchers, tossed a multitude of little bottles into the sea. They are for you, reader, and for those like you, inhabitants of the lands we too come from, but who have not had the good fortune to approach these shores.
Jean-François Dars Annick Lesne Anne Papillault

## Dreams

In the broad light of day mathematicians check their equations and their proofs, leaving no stone unturned in their search for rigour. But, at night, under the full moon, they dream, they float among the stars and wonder at the miracle of the heavens. They are inspired. Without dreams there is no art, no mathematics, no life.
Michael Atiyah

The power of dreams: such is the title given by Roger Caillois, the most rigorous of critics, to his fa- mous anthology of oneiric literature. Day, night. Calculations, inspiration. Not opposed to one another but nurturing one another. During the day ordinary creatures work. At night, they sleep (sometimes it’s the other way round). Those that Michel Atiyah speaks of, who will reveal themselves on page after page, constantly, tirelessly pass through the mirror, as one goes through a curtain, with the inimitable ease that can only be acquired through long years of effort.

## Pitiless Pitiless Reality

1. Foreword
This text describes a very personal relationship with mathematics, for let us not forget that each mathematician is “a particular case” and what is written here is valid only for the author and can- not be considered a “generic” point of view.
Mathematics is, to my mind, above all, the
most elaborate tool of thought and generator of
concepts that we possess in order to understand,
in particular, the world around us. New concepts
are engendered by a slow process of distillation in
the alembic of thought.
It is tempting at first to divide mathematics
into separate fields like geometry, the science of
space, algebra, the art of manipulating symbols,
analysis which gives access to the infinite and the
continuous, number theory, etc., but this doesn’t
describe an essential feature of the mathematical
world, that is to say that it is impossible to isolate
one part without depriving it of its essence.

2. Act of Rebellion
In mathematics, in my view, the first thing to know is that one doesn’t become a mathematician by learning; one becomes a mathematician by doing mathematics. So, it is not the “knowing” which counts, what is important it the know-how. Of course, knowledge is absolutely necessary— and there’s no question of putting aside acquired knowledge—but I have always thought that one progresses more by stalling, faced with a problem in geometry, than by absorbing more and more ill-digested knowledge.
So for me, one starts to become a mathemati- cian more or less through an act of rebellion. In what sense? In the sense that the future mathema- tician will start to think about a certain problem, and he will notice that, in fact, what he has read in the literature, what he has read in books, doesn’t correspond to his personal vision of the problem. Naturally, that is very often the result of ignorance,
but that is not important as long as his arguments are based on personal intuition and, of course, on proof. So it doesn’t matter, because in this way he’ll learn that in mathematics there is no supreme authority! A twelve-year-old pupil can very well oppose his teacher if he finds proof of what he argues, and that differentiates mathematics from the other disciplines, where the teacher can easily hide behind knowledge that the pupil doesn’t have. A child of five can say to his father, “Daddy, there isn’t any biggest number” and can be certain of it, not because he read it in a book but because he has found a proof in his mind... . There is freedom to be seized by him who recognizes it and respects the rules. And the first thing that counts is to become one’s own authority. That is to say, to understand something, not to try and check immediately if it is written in a book; that’s not the way. That will only delay his awakening to independence. What he must do, is to check in his mind if it’s true. When one has understood that, one can little by little become very familiar with a tiny portion of mathematical territory and begin a long journey across these marvellous territories that one tries to reveal from one’s own personal reference point.

3. Poetic Force
One can say that there are two aspects to the mathematician’s task: the one which consists in
proving, checking, etc. and which demands in-
tense concentration, which requires exacerbated
rationalism, but fortunately there is also the visio-
nary aspect! And the visionary aspect is a bit like a
setting in motion through intuition, which is not subject to certitudes but is more like an attraction of a poetic nature. To simplify, there are two mo- ments in mathematical discovery. There is the first moment when intuition cannot yet be formulated in transmissible terms in a rational manner. And at that point what counts is vision! Not the static aspect but a kind of poetic driving force.
This poetic force is almost impossible to put into words. When one tries to convey it, when one tries to say it, one only succeeds in turning it to stone, so to speak, and one loses the momen- tum which is essential in discovery.
Then, when enough pieces of the puzzle are in
place and one can see that the vision can be trans-
lated into solutions of problems, things change.
For example, when I started to become a mathe- matician, one of the things which struck me most
in what I found—it was while writing my thesis
with Jacques Dixmier—(photo opposite) was that
a non-commutative algebra evolves with time!
What I had shown was that in fact a non-com- mutative algebra has an evolution in time which
is completely canonical. More precisely, the evo-
lution given by the theory of Tomita, but which
depended on a state, depended in fact only on this
state modulo inner automorphisms, which are tri-
vial, which don’t exist. So that showed that it was
non-commutativity which generated time! From
nothing! Just like that! Of course the immediate
result was that an algebra has many invariants, like,
for example, its periods, that is to say the times
t when the evolution is trivial. But these results,
although possible to formulate and transmit, do
not exhaust the poetic content, the marvellous
setting in motion of the initial discovery.
4. Mathematical Reality
There are poets that I admire very much, like Yves Bonnefoy, because of their proximity, on the methodological level, to mathematics. To my mind, what distinguishes the poet from the mathematician is that the poet’s raw material is the physical reality of human experience. The main ingredient of poetry is the clash between the individual’s inner world and external reality, the violence of which always takes us by surprise. On the other hand, the mathematician’s journey is a trek through a different geographical space, through different landscapes, during which he comes up against another kind of reality. Mathematical reality is just as harsh, just as resistant as the physical reality in which we live. The moments of vision are not sufficient to enable the mathematician to actually do mathematics. That is to say that in counterpoint to the visionary aspect, in the moment which follows the proof, then come the hours of uncertainty, of suffering, the constant fear of having made a mistake. It’s a bit like going down a cliff-face which forces one to constantly look down... You have to say to yourself all the time, “Here I could have made a mistake, perhaps I did make a mistake.” You don’t know and you’re always scared! You may sometimes spend hours in terrible anguish, just because you have come up against true reality. So it’s not reality in the ordinary sense, but it is probably even more pitiless.
The notion of truth is applied to another world, which is not the world of human experience in 8
external reality but that of mathematical reality.
The crucial point to understand is that while
so many mathematicians have spent their lives exploring this world, they all agree on its contours
and its connectedness: whatever the origin of his
itinerary, one day or another if the journey is long
enough and if one refrains from confining one-self to an area of extreme specialization, one will finally reach one of the fabled cities, such as ellip- tic functions, modular forms, zeta functions, etc. “All roads lead to Rome,” and the mathematical world is interconnected. Of course that doesn’t mean that all its parts are alike, and Grothendieck in Récoltes et Semailles describes thus his path from the landscape of analysis, where he began his jour-
ney, to that of algebraic geometry:
“I still remember that striking impression (certainly
quite subjective), as if I had left behind the harsh, arid
steppes and was suddenly in a kind of ‘promised land’ whose luxuriant riches, multiplied to infinity, could be plucked, sifted wherever the hand chose to delve.”
Alexandre Grothendieck 

5. Galois
What Galois understood to a certain extent, and what is almost the starting point of modern mathe- matics, is that in fact you must be able to go beyond calculation. That is to say, not to make calculations but to do them in your head! And to understand what their nature will be, to understand what dif- ficulties you will be up against, etc., but without actually doing concrete calculations, to understand what form the result will take; what symmetry the result will have. And thus to go beyond the kind of outer envelope which you can easily become trap- ped in if you don’t lift your eyes from the wheel. You have to try and rise above calculation, to medi- tate on the level of symmetries, etc.
“To jump with both feet on the calculations; to group together operations, to classify them according to their difficulty and not according to their form; that, in my view is our mission.”
Evariste Galois
Whereas his predecessors looked for the sym- metrical functions of the roots of an equation, Galois began by breaking the symmetry, to see what was going on.... His starting point is the arbitrary choice of a root’s function, which does
not allow for any symmetry. The miracle is that
the group of invariance that he deduces passing from the function to the roots is in fact indepen- dent of the initial arbitrary choice.
Far from being outdated, Galois’s ideas still irri-
gate contemporary mathematics, simply because
of their simplicity and the movement they give
rise to. Grothendieck’s theory of motives is a natu-
ral generalization of Galois’s theory in dimension
> 0, that is to say, if you like, to polynomials with several variables. These present-day developments, like those of Galois’s differential theory, are placed directly in the dynamics of Galois’s ideas. Here we should quote his letter and testament.
“You know, dear Auguste, that these subjects are not the only ones I have explored. For some time my main meditations have been directed on the appli- cation to transcendental analysis of the theory of ambiguity. The aim was to see in a relation between quantities or transcendental functions, what exchan- ges we could make, what quantities could be subs- tituted to the given quantities without the relation ceasing to take place. In that way we see immedia- tely that many expressions that we might look for are impossible. But I don’t have the time and my ideas are not yet developed enough in this vast field.”
Evariste Galois
6. Algebra and Music
In my view, it’s crucial for a child to be exposed to music at an early age. I believe that exposing a child to music, at around five or six, tempers the preponderance in his intellect of the sense of sight, that incredible, purely visual gift, that a child de- velops very early on and which in fact is linked to geometry. Music enables us to balance that with al- gebra, that is to say music is linked to time exactly as algebra is. On the one hand, in mathematics there is a fundamental duality between geometry, which corresponds to the visual areas of the brain and which gives an instantaneous and immediate intuition. We see a geometrical figure and wham! 
That’s it, that’s all, we don’t need to explain it, we don’t want to explain it. On the other hand there
is algebra. There is nothing visual about algebra; however there is temporality; it is “in time”! That’s calculation, etc. It’s something which evolves and
it’s something which is very close to language and which has the diabolical precision of language.
And we can perceive that power, the elaboration
of algebra, through music. So for me, there is an
incredible collusion between music, perceived in this way, and algebra. For example, I adore certain preludes by Chopin because I find that they have exactly the same marvellous property of conden- sation, of distillation. It’s the kind of music which creeps into a room rather as if the window was suddenly opened by a gust of wind and then goes out the other side. To condense an idea in its most limpid, its purest form...that is, in some way, what algebra does.

7. Advice
I will end this text with a little practical advice:
Go for a walk
When you are struggling with a very complicated problem (often involving calculations), the heal- thy thing to do is to go for a long walk (without paper or pencil) and to do the calculations men- tally (ignoring the initial impression of “it’s too complicated for that”). Even if you don’t succeed, it’s good memory training and it sharpens the teeth of the intellect.
The divan
Mathematicians (male and female) generally have great difficulty in convincing their spouses that they work most intensely when they are lying in the dark on their beds. Unfortunately the invasion of computer screens and electronic mail has ren- dered this means of concentration less common: it is all the more precious for that.

Be courageous
There are two moments in mathematical discovery; there is a time when you have to be courageous: you have to climb up the rock-face and never look down.... Why? Because if you start looking down you’re going to say: “Yes, but of course, So-and-So has already studied this problem and didn’t suc- ceed in solving it, so there is no reason why I should succeed.” And you’re going to find a hun- dred rational justifications to prevent you from moving upwards. So you must make an abstrac- tion of that. You must “protect your innocence” in order for an idea to take shape without dissolving prematurely in the mists of knowledge at time t.
Stress
During his lifetime (often right at the beginning)
a mathematician is often confronted with difficul-
ties due to severe competitiveness. For example,
you receive a competitor’s “preprint” on the same subject that you’ve been working on, and you feel
you are under unreasonable pressure to publish
quickly. The only recipe I know in these cases is to
try and transform this feeling of frustration into
energy to work even harder.
Bad grace
One of my colleagues confided in me a long time
ago: “We (mathematicians) work for the grud-
ging approbation of a few friends.” It’s true that as
research is work of a solitary nature, the researcher
feels the need for approval in one way or another.
The truth is that there is only one judge who really
counts; that is you. And you can’t bargain with
that one. It is simply a waste of time to worry too much about the opinion of others; no theorem was ever proved by referendum, and as Feynman said: “Why do you care what other people think?”
Alain Connes



## Mathematical Physics

Ivan Todorov
Bulgarian Academy of Sciences

My parents were philologists (and so is my bro- ther, Tzvetan), thus, as a child, I did not benefit from an early exposure to exact sciences. I inhe- rited instead an interest in the history of science and a taste for communication between science and humanities.

It has been always fascinating to discover the same mathematical law governing apparently different phenomena. Instances of Felix Klein’s pre-established harmony between mathematics (a game of pure thought) and natural phenomena seem even more impressive. The realization that numbers govern the sounds of music was a leading theme for Pythagoras and his school, the founders of mathematics as a science. Here is a more recent (and less popular) example of this type. After years of intensive study, following previous theoretical and experimental work of many physicists, Max Planck wrote in 1900 his formula for the energy distribution of black-body radiation that marked the beginning of quantum theory. Nobody seems to have noticed, however, that the small frequency (or high temperature) expansion of Planck’s formula gives rise to the
Bernoulli numbers. Jacob Bernoulli (1654–1705) introduced his numbers in the context of probability theory. In the 19th century they were related to modular forms that are basic to analytic number theory. The integral coefficients in the Fourier expansion of such forms, which play a prominent role in the context of number theory, appear as multiplicities in the interpretation of statistical mechanics.


我的父母是语言学家（我的兄弟 Tzvetan 也是），因此，在我童年时期，并没有受到对精确科学的早期接触的益处。相反，我继承了对科学历史的兴趣和对科学与人文学科之间交流的品味。

发现相同的数学规律似乎支配着不同的现象总是令人着迷的。菲利克斯·克莱因（Felix Klein）预先设定的数学与自然现象之间的和谐似乎更加令人印象深刻。认识到数字统治着音乐的声音是毕达哥拉斯及其学派、数学作为一门科学的奠基人的主题。这里是这种类型的一个更为近期（并不那么流行）的例子。在经过许多物理学家之前的理论和实验工作后，马克斯·普朗克于1900年写下了他的黑体辐射能量分布的公式，这标志着量子理论的开始。然而，似乎没有人注意到普朗克公式的小频率（或高温度）展开产生了伯努利数。雅各布·伯努利（1654–1705）在概率论的背景下引入了他的这些数。在19世纪，它们与模形式相关，模形式是解析数论的基础。在这些形式的傅立叶展开的整数系数在数论背景中发挥着重要作用，它们在统计力学的解释中作为多重性出现。

My young collaborator N. M. Nikolov and
I pointed out (in a paper completed during my
recent stay at the IHES, following a stimulating
discussion with Maxim Kontsevitch) that the
unique, normalized, modular form of weight
four reproduces Planck’s black-body energy
distribution in conformally compactified
space-time.


I also recall with pleasure a paper by Ya. Stanev
and myself, initiated at the IHES (benefiting from
the advice of another visitor, B. B. Venkov), in
which the Galois group for the roots of unity was
used to solve the Schwarz (finite monodromy)
problem for the Knizhnik-Zamolodchikov
equation, providing another link between
number theory and, this time, conformal field theory models.

我的年轻合作者 N. M. Nikolov 和我指出（在我最近在IHES逗留期间完成的一篇论文中，这是在与Maxim Kontsevitch进行了激动人心的讨论后），权重为四的唯一、标准化的模形在共形紧致化的时空中再现了普朗克的黑体能量分布。

我还愉快地回忆起与Ya. Stanev 合著的一篇论文，这篇论文是在IHES发起的（得益于另一位访客 B. B. Venkov 的建议），该论文使用了对于单位根的伽罗瓦群来解决 Schwarz（有限单值）问题，这为 Knizhnik-Zamolodchikov 方程提供了一个连接，进一步将数论与这次是共形场论模型联系在一起。

The legendary Alexandre Grothendieck (to whom the IHES owes much of its fame of the 1960s) explains in his “Recoltes et semailles” that a major stimulus for his abstract approach to algebraic geometry was the desire to find a common ground for the geometry of the continuum and the discrete «geometry of numbers». Alain Connes provides another unifying view of the discrete and the continuous—within noncommutative geometry. I vividly remember the series of seminar talks of Dirk Kreimer on his Hopf algebra approach to renormalization when the discussion (often continuing at lunch) revealed a close link with the Hopf algebra Connes and Moscovici had introduced, studying the transverse index theorem in non-commutative geometry. The visionary talk of Pierre Cartier at the 40th anniversary of the IHES, in which he dreamed of a unification of the ideas of Grothendieck, Connes-Kreimer and Kontsevitch, seems nowadays closer to reality than eight years ago.

传奇人物亚历山大·格罗滕迪克（IHES在1960年代的声誉很大程度上归功于他）在他的《收获与播种》中解释说，他对代数几何的抽象方法的主要刺激之一是希望找到连续几何和离散“数学几何”之间的共同基础。阿兰·孔涅为离散和连续提供了另一种统一的观点——在非交换几何中。我清楚地记得 Dirk Kreimer 就他的 Hopf 代数方法进行重整化的系列研讨会报告，讨论中（通常在午餐时继续）揭示了他的方法与 Connes 和 Moscovici 引入的 Hopf 代数之间的密切联系，他们研究了非交换几何中的横向指数定理。皮埃尔·卡尔蒂埃在IHES成立40周年时的富有远见的演讲中，他梦想着将格罗滕迪克、孔涅-克雷默和孔采维奇的思想统一起来，现在似乎比八年前更接近现实。

## In Praise of Tautology

Anna Wienhard
University of Chicago

 A rigorous, correct mathematical statement is true independent of the circumstances, so it is always a tautology. This might make it seem empty or boring.

Mathematical thinking is exploring and dis- covering the unknown tautology. Recovering the diversity, creating and finding inner structures of the tautological, which, when regarded from the outside, as a whole seems meaningless.
But it unfolds to a beautiful world in which many tautologies are waiting to be discovered and created, and structured to form a meaningful whole which will never be completed.

Anna Wienhard

严密、正确的数学陈述是独立于情境的真理，因此它始终是一个重言式。这可能使它看起来空洞或无聊。

数学思维是在探索和发现未知的重言式。恢复多样性，创造和发现重言式的内在结构，当从外部看时，整体似乎毫无意义。但它展开成一个美丽的世界，在这个世界中，有许多等待被发现、被创造和被构造成有意义整体的重言式，而这个过程永远不会完成。

## New Worlds

Giovanni Landi
University of Trieste

Rather that the opposite of false or fallacious, for Greeks truth is a-letheia (α-λήθηεια) namely what is un-veiled, revealed, not-ignored.

Continuously searching for minimal traces
that would allow us to open doors on new and splendid worlds that would be unveiled ‘enfin’,
we slowly move though concealed realms. And
the lucky travelers-seekers bring to light, unveil, fragments of ‘truth’, rewarded with instants of
pure, solitary joy.

与虚假或谬误相反，对于希腊人来说，真理是 a-letheia（α-λήθηεια），即揭示、显露、不被忽视的东西。

不断搜索能够让我们打开通向新世界的门的微小痕迹，终于揭示的东西，
我们缓慢地穿越隐藏的领域。而幸运的旅行者和探求者会揭示出“真理”的碎片，换来纯净、孤独的快乐瞬间。

## The Music Pavilion

Institute for Advanced Study, Princeton Fields Medal Crafoord Prize Wolf Prize
Pierre Deligne

The heart of the IHES was for me the construction with the big bay windows on the edge of the wood, a former music pavilion, with, at the time, a library on the left and a conference room on the right. There, every Tuesday afternoon took place the Bois-Marie seminar on algebraic geometry where Grothendieck edified the algebraic geometry which is now familiar to us.

Contrary to what I sometimes hear said, his
aim was not maximal generality. The ideal was
that theorems should be well understood, that
the structure of their proof should consist of
definitions, carefully chosen so that each geometric
idea should shed its light afar. A key word was
“dévissage,” or “unscrewing.”

I was stunned the day he proved the base change
theorem for a proper morphism $f：g^* Rf_* \stackrel{\sim}{\to} Rf^{'}_* g^{'*}$
starting from the case of a constant sheaf on a
family of curves.

The lemmas followed one another, self-evident,
and, by the end of an hour, the heart of the theo-
rem was exposed.

That manner of proceeding has remained my ideal,
rarely attained: that nothing should remain visible of
the efforts it cost to reach an understanding.

Pierre Deligne


音乐亭

IHES 的核心对我而言是一座带有大玻璃窗户的建筑，位于树林边缘，曾经是一座音乐亭，当时左边是图书馆，右边是一个会议室。在那里，每周二下午都会举行 Bois-Marie 代数几何研讨会，Grothendieck 在那里建立了我们现在熟悉的代数几何。

与我有时听到的说法相反，他的目标不是追求最大的一般性。理想状态是定理应该被很好地理解，它们的证明结构应该由定义组成，这样每个几何思想都能在远处投下它的光芒。一个关键词是“dévissage”，或者“unscrewing”（拆解）。

有一天，他从一族曲线上的常数层的情况出发，证明了适合态射的基变换定理 $f：g^* Rf_* \stackrel{\sim}{\to} Rf^{'}_* g^{'*}$ ，我感到很震惊。

引理一个接一个地出现，不证自明，一个小时结束时，定理的核心被揭示出来。

这种处理方式一直是我的理想，很少能够达到：让达成共识的过程中的努力不可见。

Pierre Deligne

## Long Live the Whale

Claire Voisin
CNRS - IMJ - IHES CNRS Silver medal

The practice of mathematics ostensibly arouses cu- riosity, and yet mathematicians cannot talk about
their subject without provoking boredom or pain. Moreover, each one of us would be delighted to
do the honours of his area and help people to understand why a particular conjecture seems of capital importance to him. But expressions such
as “topological invariants” or “polynomial equa- tions”, “metric curvature” or “moduli spaces”
being censored, we can only take refuge in timo-
rous silence.

To break out of this silence I will attempt a
comparison. The picture which comes to my
mind is borrowed from the world of Moby Dick.
Like the watery element, mathematics is above
all coherent, even if the immensity of the subject
prevents contact between the most far-flung areas.
As in the marine world, the hidden part, the sub-
marine part, is infinitely more important than the
visible part. It is that which carries us, even if the
structures that it hides have not yet emerged, and
will only later on change their status to become
accessible to our understanding.

As for the mathematician, whether it be Ishmael, Ahab or Queequeg, he deciphers as far as he can that which is interpretable on the surface, yet keeps an eye open for the white whale (more or less impressive, according to his temperament or luck) which leads him to embark on these par- ticular waters.

Claire Voisin

数学实践表面上激发了好奇心，然而数学家们在谈论他们的主题时却不可避免地引起了无聊或痛苦。此外，我们每个人都会很高兴为他的领域做主持，并帮助人们理解为什么某个猜想对他来说至关重要。但是，由于“拓扑不变量”或“多项式方程”、“度量曲率”或“模空间”等表达方式被审查，我们只能退而求其次，保持胆怯的沉默。

为了打破这种沉默，我将尝试做一个比较。我脑海中浮现的画面借用自《白鲸记》的世界。与水元素一样，数学首先是一致的，即使主题的广大阻止了最遥远的领域之间的联系。就像海洋世界一样，隐藏的部分，水下的部分，远比可见的部分重要得多。正是它托起了我们，即使它隐藏的结构尚未显现，而将来只有在改变它们的地位以使它们变得可以理解之后才能让我们接触到。

至于数学家，无论是伊舍梅尔、艾哈布还是奎奎格，他都会尽其所能地解读表面上可解释的部分，但同时也会留心那条白鲸（根据他的性格或运气而更或更不令人印象深刻），这使他踏上这片特殊的水域。


## What Does One Write on It?

Jean-Marc Deshouillers
University of Bordeaux

A blackboard. Two men sitting silent throughout the scene; one nods his head, gets up, writes a for- mula on the board and sits down again; the other one frowns, gets up in his turn, goes to the board and modifies the formula.... Mathematicians— male or female—don’t recognise themselves in this caricature of their activity, of their communication, their social life. I take the opportunity here to pay tribute to the contemporary authors, directors, scenographers who represent mathe- matical activity more realistically and sometimes with great subtlety (I am thinking in particular of David Auburn and his play Proof, in French La Preuve). Not only are mathematicians not silent, but in addition, communication between them cannot be reduced to the exchange of “formulas”. However, if the blackboard is not an essential instrument in communication between mathematicians (you can “do maths” in a bus, while strolling along, during a meal...), it is neverthe- less an important element, present in conference rooms and offices.

What does one write on it?

Mathematical discourse is extremely codified;
besides, it is the formal aspect that the expres-
sion first evokes. It is its reason for being: the role
of formalism is (and should only be) to validate
the discourse. But the discourse is significant. As sophisticated as the form may be, it doesn’t create
meaning any more than the synthesis of molecules,
however complex, creates life. When mathemati-
cians talk to each other, they re communicating
about meaning; they are manipulating concepts,
exchanging mental representations. If this is com-
mon practice nowadays, I can remember, it was atthe end of the sixties, one of the greatest mathe- maticians who, when asked a delicate question, began by scribbling a tiny figure in a corner of the blackboard before quickly rubbing it out and serving up a totally formalized answer.

During the phase of creation, monologue or dia- logue, the blackboard transcends its role of tool of reflection and takes an active part in the creation: it reflects the graffito, inflects thought, corrobora- ting the remark of the poet, which I quote from memory: “What I write forces me to think that I was far from thinking that I was thinking”.

It is also in the phase of presentation, essentially oral, that the blackboard is an aid to discourse: one writes on it the articulations, it’s an aid to memory (the text remains on it often for more than half an hour). Filling it up gives the tempo of the talk. But above all the blackboard enables us to represent mental images: it is certainly this role of tracer, of revelator of the mathematical activity of creation which makes it an important element in mathematical iconography.

Will the blackboard be left aside in favour of
new technologies?The present craze for these tools suggests that possibility. And yet—even when
new technology is mastered—it cannot convey
the dimension of craftsmanship, the personal, physical, human dimension which the black-
board brings to mathematical discourse. Are we
at a crossroads where the blackboard is still our
wax tablet, with all the possibilities of immediate
and spontaneous representation of mathematical
art?

Jean-Marc Deshouillers

黑板。两个人默默地坐在场景中，其中一个点点头，站起来，在黑板上写下一个公式，然后再坐下；另一个皱着眉头，轮到他站起来，走到黑板前修改公式...数学家，无论男性还是女性，都无法在这种对他们的活动、交流和社交生活的讽刺中认出自己。我在这里借机向当代作者、导演和舞台设计师表示敬意，他们更真实地描绘数学活动，有时甚至非常微妙（我特别想到的是大卫·奥本及其剧本《证明》）。

数学家不仅不是沉默的，而且，他们之间的交流不能简化为“公式”的交换。然而，如果黑板不是数学家之间沟通的必要工具（你可以在公交车上、漫步中、用餐时“做数学”），它仍然是一个重要的元素，在会议室和办公室中都有。

在黑板上写什么呢？

数学话语极为规范化；此外，表达的第一印象是其形式方面。这是其存在的原因：形式主义的角色是（也应该只是）验证话语。但是话语是有意义的。形式可能再复杂，它不再创造意义，就像分子的综合，无论多么复杂，也不能创造生命一样。当数学家彼此交谈时，他们在交流有关意义的信息；他们操纵概念，交换心理表征。如果这是现代的常见做法，我记得在60年代末，有一位最伟大的数学家，在被问及一个微妙的问题时，开始在黑板的一个角落涂鸦一幅小图，然后迅速擦掉它，提供一个完全形式化的答案。

在创作阶段，无论是独白还是对话，黑板超越了它作为反思工具的角色，积极参与创作：它反映涂鸦，弯曲思维，证实了我从记忆中引用的诗人的话：“我写的东西迫使我思考，我远非认为我正在思考”。

在展示阶段，主要是口头的阶段，黑板是话语的一种辅助工具：人们在上面写下关节，它是记忆的辅助工具（文本经常停留在上面超过半个小时）。填写它给演讲定了节奏。但最重要的是，黑板使我们能够表示心理图像：正是这种描绘、揭示数学创作活动的角色，使其成为数学图像学中的重要元素。

黑板会被新技术取代吗？目前对这些工具的热衷表明了这种可能性。然而，即使掌握了新技术，它也不能传达黑板为数学话语带来的手工艺、个人、物理、人的维度。我们是否正处于一个十字路口，黑板仍然是我们的蜡板，具有即时和自发表示数学艺术的所有可能性？

## Solidarity

A mathematician who travels abroad is never a tourist. In a normal situation, given the pro- fessional aspect, he finds himself in a convivial environment where certain values are tacitly sha- red, humanist values which characterise more or less the mathematical community: mathemati- cians are liberals, despite a few blunders as during the international congress in 1920 in Strasbourg, where the Germans were excluded! They were only reintegrated in 1928.... However, Soviet mathematicians under Stalin did not come up against the same ideological errors as the biolo- gists, for example. We must say they were in an ambiguous situation. The regime needed good scientists for its nuclear and military industry and tended to look after them, and mathematicians were sufficiently removed from the direct appli- cations of their work to be deemed inoffensive, a bit like musicians or chess players. It’s true that this position, somewhat in retreat, can be a ha- ven in extreme situations and conduces to the development of a moral and physical aptitude to abstract oneself from reality which borders on autism. One takes refuge in mathematics a bit like Miguel Angel Estrella in prison playing sonatas in his mind. I remember, at the worst moments during the Algerian war, always having a maths book in my pack which I would read whenever I had a quiet quarter of an hour to myself.
A certain number of us have taken advan- tage of this ambiguous status of mathematics when participating in international congresses held in countries ruled by dictators. It was the case in Ceausescu’s Romania, it was the case in Czechoslovakia after the Prague Spring, where I went on behalf of the Jean Hus, an association presided by Jean-Pierre Vernant, Jacques Derrida and Nathalie Roussarie, a relative of Adrien Douady. I took with me banned books (Plato’s Republic, for example) and a considerable amount of money, the equivalent of ten thousand euros today. Piotr Uhl, one of the leaders of the resis- tance at the time, was a native of Prague and a man of the old school: after having asked me not to stand too close to the window because of police surveillance, as soon as I had given him the pac- ket, he sat down at his typewriter and typed me a receipt! I swallowed it as soon as I had gone out of the door.
Laurent Schwarz, Jean-Louis Verdier, Marcel Berger, Alain Guichardet and I also went to Poland. The situation was different, just after Jaruzelski’s putsch, the 13th of December 1981. Speaking of this, nowadays there isn’t a right- minded Pole who doesn’t do justice to Jaruzelski. Thanks to his military putsch, he could say to the Russians, “No need to invade Poland, I have the situation under control.” We should remember that his parents were killed in Katyn and that, if he wore dark glasses, it’s because his eyes were burned by the snow in Siberia where
he spent ten years in deportation. Anyway, it was December ’81 and the International Congress of Mathematics was to be held in Warsaw in ’82! The classical dilemma: to go or not to go? To caution
or to boycott? Hence our exploratory mission in February ’82. We found a society under close sur- veillance, with the appropriate number of police indicators and glamorous fortune seekers at the
bar of the one hotel reserved for foreigners. The
day after we arrived, at an official meeting at the Science Academy in Copernicus Square, the pre- sident comes onto the stage. “I have invited you
in the name of the Polish Mathematical Society, unfortunately it has been banned as well as all the other associations....” However there was still a buffet, so we started to talk. A student comes up:
“Are you the French people? I have a mission for you....” And he takes a letter out of his pocket
and holds it out to Laurent Schwartz, who puts
on his glasses to read it.... I kick him. “What’s
the matter?” I kick him again and this time he
understands and puts his glasses away. The letter
contained a list of a hundred and fifty impriso-
ned mathematicians. “They” hoped we could take
advantage of the international congress to get
them out of gaol. The young man who had given
us the letter bends towards me: “Don’t you want
to come to Wroclaw?” I exchanged glances with
Jean-Louis Verdier, always so solid and magnifi-
cent, and we said yes. The French Embassy, for
whom we were the only presentable French dele-
gation at that time, did the necessary work, and
that very evening we had plane tickets and our
passports duly stamped with visas. 

Usually, at eight o’clock in the morning, Wroclaw is full of people, lorries, smoking factory chimneys. This time, nothing. General strike, town lifeless, apart from the patrols. As for us, we had no instructions. But a signpost indicates
“Ratuz”—Rathaus, that is to say Town Hall in Polish German—and there, on the main square, we find several student cafés open. We go in and feel immediately that we are on the right track: instead of finding us a table, the bar tender lets us stand around waiting like everybody else. So we are among equals, therefore in a democracy- friendly environment.... Indeed, once we have sat down, a young man comes up to us: “Are you the French people?” His friends join him, so it isn’t a police provocation, and he takes us to a meeting with a leader of the resistance, a Jewish mathema- tician who had been imprisoned, then released, and who wanted to discuss whether the mathe- matics congress should take place or not. The official regime wanted it to take place at all costs: an international mathematical congress is a sign
of normality with a lot of “added value.” Finally
it took place after a short delay, in 1983. Out of
the hundred and fifty mathematicians on our list,
a hundred and forty nine had been released. There
remained the hundred and fiftieth, whose release
Christophe Soulé and I obtained at the end of the congress. When the whole thing was over and we got on the plane home, I felt an envelope on my seat as I sat down. I put it in my bag and didn’t open it until we got to Paris. On it was written: “Thank you for everything,” followed by all the big names of Solidarnosc.
At that time, Jean Dieudonné also interve- ned a lot. As he was rather right-wing and didn’t make a secret of it, it was natural for him to pro- test against communist leaders, but he also went to Montevideo and succeeded in persuading the Uruguay Defence Minister, a hulking great brute, to release José-Luis Massera by telling him: “In a civilised country, you can’t do that kind of thing.”
It was the right argument: the notion of civi- lisation is indeed a decisive one. I am firmly convinced that mathematics is an integral part of civilization and moreover that without mathema- tics civilization wouldn’t exist. Obviously in some ways maths is that almost autistic activity I have already mentioned which can be done with just a paper and pencil but that only corresponds to one particular phase; Roger Godement once said jokin- gly that we should be attached to the arts faculty. Fortunately it was only a joke.... Mathematicians don’t have tools, but they are constantly creating tools which just as constantly escape them and pervade all fields, from geometry to astronomy. And when my granddaughters start to count, they take in this activity like a gift of civilization which is their natural heritage. Mathematics reaches apotheosis each time one does maths without rea- lizing it, and the true ambition of a mathematician is that mathematics should belong to everyone.

团结

一个出国旅行的数学家从来都不是游客。在正常情况下，考虑到职业因素，他会发现自己处于一个充满友好氛围的环境中，在这个环境中某些价值观被默契地共享，这些价值观或多或少地体现了数学界的人文精神：尽管在1920年斯特拉斯堡国际会议上曾出现过将德国人排除在外的错误，数学家们总体上是自由主义者！他们直到1928年才被重新接纳……然而，斯大林统治下的苏联数学家并没有遇到像生物学家那样的意识形态错误。我们必须说他们处于一个模棱两可的局面。政权需要优秀的科学家为其核工业和军事工业服务，因而倾向于照顾他们，而数学家们的工作与实际应用相距甚远，被视为无害，有点像音乐家或国际象棋选手。确实，这种相对退隐的位置在极端情况下可以成为一种避难所，并促使人们发展出一种几近自闭的从现实中抽离的道德和身体能力。有人会在数学中寻求避难，就像米格尔·安赫尔·埃斯特雷拉在监狱里用心中演奏奏鸣曲一样。我记得，在阿尔及利亚战争的最糟糕时刻，我的背包里总是放着一本数学书，在有片刻安静时我会拿出来读。

我们中的一些人在参加由独裁国家举办的国际会议时利用了这种数学的模棱两可地位。在齐奥塞斯库统治下的罗马尼亚是这样，在布拉格之春后的捷克斯洛伐克也是这样，我是代表让·胡斯协会去的，该协会由让-皮埃尔·韦尔南特、雅克·德里达和阿德里安·杜阿迪的亲戚娜塔莉·鲁萨里主持。我带去了被禁的书籍（例如柏拉图的《理想国》）和相当数量的钱，相当于今天的一万欧元。当时的抵抗领袖之一皮奥特·乌尔是布拉格人，一个古老学派的人：在要求我不要站得离窗户太近以防警察监视之后，他一拿到包裹就坐在打字机前给我打收据！我一出门就把它吞了。

洛朗·施瓦茨、让-路易·韦尔迪耶、马塞尔·贝尔热、阿兰·吉沙尔戴和我还去了波兰。情况有所不同，那是在雅鲁泽尔斯基政变之后的1981年12月13日。说到这里，现在没有一个头脑清醒的波兰人不承认雅鲁泽尔斯基的功劳。由于他的军事政变，他可以对苏联人说，“没有必要入侵波兰，我已经控制了局势。”我们应该记住，他的父母在卡廷被杀害，他戴墨镜是因为在西伯利亚的雪地里度过了十年流放生活，他的眼睛被雪弄伤了。不管怎样，那是1981年12月，而1982年的国际数学大会将在华沙举行！经典的两难：去还是不去？支持还是抵制？因此我们在1982年2月进行了探索性任务。我们发现了一个被密切监视的社会，外国人唯一可以住的酒店里充斥着相应数量的警察和迷人的机会主义者。

我们到达的第二天，在哥白尼广场的科学院的一次正式会议上，主席登上讲台。“我以波兰数学学会的名义邀请你们，不幸的是它和所有其他协会一样被禁止了……”不过还是有自助餐，所以我们开始交谈。一名学生走过来：“你们是法国人吗？我有一个任务给你们……”，他从口袋里拿出一封信，递给洛朗·施瓦茨，洛朗戴上眼镜读了起来……我踢了他一下。“怎么了？”我又踢了他一下，这次他明白了，把眼镜收了起来。信里有一百五十名被监禁数学家的名单。“他们”希望我们能利用国际会议的机会把他们从监狱里救出来。给我们信的年轻人靠近我说：“你们想去弗罗茨瓦夫吗？”我与永远坚定而杰出的让-路易·韦尔迪耶交换了眼神，我们说好。法国大使馆，作为当时唯一在场的可接受的法国代表团，为我们做了必要的工作，当晚我们拿到了机票和签好签证的护照。

通常，早上八点的弗罗茨瓦夫满是人、卡车、冒烟的工厂烟囱。这次，什么都没有。总罢工，城镇死寂，只有巡逻队。至于我们，没有指示。但一个路标指示“Ratuz”—即德语的市政厅的意思—在市中心广场，我们发现几家学生咖啡馆开着。我们走进去，立刻感觉自己找对了路：酒吧招待让我们像其他人一样站着等位，而不是给我们找桌子。因此我们是平等的，所以是在一个支持民主的环境中……果然，一旦我们坐下，一位年轻人走过来：“你们是法国人吗？”他的朋友们也加入了，所以这不是警察的挑衅，他带我们去见一位抵抗领袖，一位被监禁后获释的犹太数学家，他想讨论是否应该举行数学大会。官方政权无论如何都希望它能举行：国际数学大会是正常的标志，附带很多“附加值”。最后它在短暂延迟后于1983年举行。在我们名单上的一百五十名数学家中，有一百四十九人被释放。剩下的一位数学家，在会议结束时克里斯托弗·苏莱和我成功争取到他的释放。当一切结束后，我们坐上回国的飞机，我在座位上感觉到一个信封。我把它放进包里，直到我们到达巴黎才打开。上面写着：“感谢你们的一切”，并附有团结工会的所有大人物的签名。

那时，让·迪厄多内也参与了很多。他是个相当右倾的人，也不掩饰，因此反对共产领导人对他来说是很自然的事，但他也去了蒙得维的亚，通过告诉乌拉圭国防部长，一个大块头的暴徒，说服他释放了何塞-路易斯·马塞拉：“在一个文明国家，你不能做这种事。”这是对的论点：文明的概念确实是一个决定性的因素。我坚信数学是文明的一部分，而且没有数学，文明就不会存在。显然，从某种角度来说，数学确实是我之前提到的几近自闭的活动，只需要纸和笔，但这只是对应一个特定阶段；罗杰·戈德曼曾经开玩笑说我们应该附属于艺术学院。幸好这只是个玩笑……数学家没有工具，但他们不断创造工具，而这些工具不断逃脱他们的控制并渗透到各个领域，从几何学到天文学。当我的孙女们开始数数时，她们接受这种活动，就像接受文明的礼物，这是她们的自然遗产。每次无意识地做数学时，数学都会达到顶峰，真正的数学家的志向是数学应该属于每一个人。

## North-South

I have spent some twenty years working in Europe
and the U.S. and the remaining part working in
a developing country. I am constantly preoccu-
pied with the question of what does it take for researchers in mathematical sciences working in developing countries to be able to contribute to
the advancement of knowledge at the same level
as their colleagues in the North. What has been observed over the years is that most of the talen-
ted people coming from developing countries do
their graduate studies in Europe and the U.S., the
majority of whom do not go back to their coun-
tries, thus contributing to the brain drain. Some
of the highly motivated graduates do return, and
within a few years their research comes to a halt.
They are perfectly capable of training students
at the undergraduate level; the talented students
among these pursue their graduate studies out-
side, and this cycle cannot be broken.
Governments in developing countries, ove-
rwhelmed with problems such as poverty and
disease, do not have the means, or the vision to
invest in research. I keep wondering, how many
geniuses born among the poor nations did not
get any opportunity to develop, and whose talents
were lost. It is now certain that all races, given the same opportunities, can contribute to the advan- cement of science.

Sponsoring research centers is an ancient idea that played a fundamental role in the advancement of mathematics and sciences. The establishment of the Library of Alexandria at the beginning of the 3rd Century BC during the reign of Ptolemy II of Egypt served as a beacon of knowledge for many centuries. It also served as a research center where mathematicians such as Euclid, Archimedes and Apollonius worked under its roof. Another major event in the East is the establishment of the House of Wisdom by the Caliph Harun al-Rashid in the 7th Century. Later his son Al-Mammon sponso- red many mathematicians such as Al-Khawarizmi, the Musa Brothers and Thabit ibn Qurra who contributed not only to the translation of Greek mathematics, but also added their own inven- tions such as algebra. It is easy to imagine that without these critical decisions in history, civiliza- tion would not have reached this advanced state. In the 19th-century research centers such as the mathematics institute in Göttingen, the mathe- matics produced by Gauss, Riemann, Dirichlet, Hilbert, Weyl and others led the way to marvelous developments. In the modern era it is now uni- versally recognized that civilizations must invest in science and mathematics as a guaranteed way to progress.
It is also well documented that for talent to
flourish it must be nurtured, otherwise it cannot flourish. Because of this, it is the moral duty of
rich societies to help the underdeveloped coun-
tries to discover and train talented people and to
give them the opportunity to contribute to the advancement of civilization. The Indian mathe- matician Ramanujan provides the best example of
how easy it is for geniuses not to be fully appre-
ciated. I have no doubt that many potentially
exceptional persons in developing countries are lost to poverty and disease.
The IHES provides the best example of how advanced societies provide nearly perfect condi- tions for talented scientists and mathematicians to be at the frontiers of research. The needs of such dedicated people are modest, and it is easy to calculate that the returns of investments that governments pay in support of fundamental research are astronomical. If a fund is established where 0.1% of profits resulting from spin-offs of scientific ideas are taken, then this will support mathematicians and scientists for a long time. One can only hope that politicians are kept aware of this fact, and that investing in science, not only in the developed world, but also in the under- developed world is the best bet to keep moving forward.

我在欧洲和美国工作了大约二十年，其余时间在发展中国家工作。我一直在思考一个问题，即发展中国家的数学科学研究人员如何才能像北方国家的同事一样为知识的进步做出贡献。多年来观察到的是，大多数来自发展中国家的有才华的人在欧洲和美国攻读研究生，他们中的大多数不会回到自己的国家，导致人才流失。一些高度激励的毕业生确实会返回，但几年内他们的研究就会停滞。他们完全有能力培训本科生；其中有才华的学生会在外面攻读研究生，这个循环无法打破。
发展中国家的政府被贫困和疾病等问题所困扰，没有资金，也没有愿景投资于研究。我一直在想，有多少天才出生在贫穷国家，但没有机会发展，他们的才能被浪费了。现在可以肯定的是，所有种族在相同的机会下，都能为科学的进步做出贡献。

资助研究中心是一个古老的理念，对数学和科学的进步起了根本性的作用。在公元前三世纪初埃及托勒密二世统治时期建立的亚历山大图书馆就是一个知识灯塔，持续了几个世纪。它也是一个研究中心，数学家如欧几里得、阿基米德和阿波罗尼奥斯都在其屋檐下工作。在东方的另一个重大事件是哈伦·拉希德哈里发在七世纪建立的智慧之家。后来他的儿子马蒙资助了许多数学家，如花剌子密、穆萨兄弟和萨比特·伊本·库拉，他们不仅翻译了希腊数学，还增加了自己的发明，如代数。很容易想象，如果没有这些历史上的关键决策，文明不会达到如此先进的状态。十九世纪的研究中心，如哥廷根数学研究所，产生了高斯、黎曼、狄利克雷、希尔伯特、魏尔等人的数学，带来了奇妙的发展。在现代社会，现在普遍承认，文明必须投资于科学和数学，这是进步的保证方式。
也有充分的记录表明，天赋必须得到培养，否则无法发展。因为这个原因，富裕社会有道德义务帮助欠发达国家发现和培养有才华的人，并给予他们机会为文明的进步做出贡献。印度数学家拉马努金是天才未被充分欣赏的最好例子。我毫不怀疑，许多在发展中国家潜在的杰出人才因贫困和疾病而失去。

高等科学研究所（IHES）提供了最佳范例，说明先进社会如何为有才华的科学家和数学家提供几乎完美的条件，使他们站在研究的前沿。这些专职人员的需求很少，很容易计算出政府在支持基础研究方面的投资回报是巨大的。如果设立一个基金，将科学创意产生的利润的0.1%用于支持数学家和科学家，那么这将长期支持他们。只能希望政治家能意识到这一事实，投资于科学，不仅在发达国家，也在欠发达国家，是保持前进的最佳途径。

## Privilege

After the École Polytechnique and the University
of Orsay, the IHES was the third French insti- tution I frequented, in September 2002. It’s a place not quite like any other. For the first time, my employer, the CNRS, had given me leave of absence. For the first time, I benefited from a huge privilege, an office of my own. And, above all, for the first time I was immersed in a totally cosmo- politan universe.
The IHES asks almost nothing of its visitors,
neither teaching nor administrative tasks, not even
the obligation to obtain mathematical results (at
least in the short term). At most—sometimes—
one is asked to write a report to select potential
visitors or postdoctoral research fellows. It is
conceived like an earthly bubble where one has
total freedom to do research and freedom to think,
either completely alone or in active collaboration
with other visitors (or both alternately). It is a
haven of peace, isolated from the torments of the
outside world. That is how, for five years, thanks to
the support of the Scientific Council of the IHES,
Laurent Lafforgue and I were able to invite more
than fifteen close collaborators for long periods and to set up several seminars jointly with other orga- nisms of the Paris region. That’s how, for five years, thanks to the comfort that a research position at the CNRS affords, I was also able to pursue, in complete serenity, my research on “the programme of Langlands p-adic”, which, out of respect for the reader, I will not elaborate on here.
For the IHES is more than just an institute for research in mathematics, or theoretical physics or biology. It is also a place where Culture and the quest for Knowledge, in the wide sense (not only scientific), are all-important. That poor culture, henceforth so mistreated that to possess just a little of it is enough to make you hopelessly old fashio- ned. That painful knowledge which, more and more reticent to be displayed, appears all the more vain as it is reserved for a tiny elite.
I remember countless conversations, scientific
or otherwise, in front of a backboard, around the lunch table or over coffee. Conversations which
were always interesting, rarely easy, where subjects
as diverse as philosophy, history, literature, politics, religion, education or music were discussed (not
to mention scientific subjects, that goes without saying). Because even if most of the mathemati-
cians, theoretical physicists or biologists that I met from around the world devote themselves body and soul to their research, they are also discrete but brilliant personalities, often very cultivated; reserved but open-minded, critical but generous.
The researchers—Russians, Chinese, Indians, Americans, Africans, Europeans—have moulded the IHES in their image: a place where the most advanced theoretical scientific research is carried out but also a place where a humanistic, tolerant and often even disenchanted vision of the world is developed; a vision where the discovery of knowledge constitutes the ultimate achievement.
In a few weeks, I shall be leaving for a long stay abroad. I shall take with me thousands of hours of reflection spent at the IHES, dozens of wrong tracks laboriously pursued, a few mathematical discoveries but also hundreds of brilliant conver- sations; in other words an inexhaustible treasure. I shall be taking too, and above all, the memory of all the researchers who, like me, consider the search for truth (scientific truth in this case) a pri- vilege and one of the noblest human endeavours.
Christophe Breuil 

特权

在École Polytechnique和奥赛大学之后，IHES是我光顾的第三个法国机构，是在2002年9月。这是一个与众不同的地方。第一次，我的雇主CNRS给我了休假。第一次，我享受到了巨大的特权，一个属于自己的办公室。最重要的是，第一次，我沉浸在一个完全国际化的环境中。

IHES几乎不向其访客提出任何要求，无论是教学还是行政任务，甚至没有取得数学成果的义务（至少在短期内）。至多有时要求写一份报告，以筛选潜在的访客或博士后研究员。它被构想为一个地球上的泡沫，在这里人们可以完全自由地进行研究和思考，可以完全独立，也可以与其他访客积极合作（或者两者交替进行）。这是一个和平的避风港，与外界的动荡隔绝。就是这样，五年来，感谢IHES科学委员会的支持，洛朗·拉福格和我得以邀请超过十五位密切合作的同事进行长期合作，并与巴黎地区的其他机构共同举办了几次研讨会。就是这样，五年来，感谢CNRS研究职位提供的舒适条件，我也得以在完全安宁的状态下继续我的“p-adic Langlands计划”的研究，出于对读者的尊重，我在此不再赘述。

IHES不仅仅是一个数学、理论物理或生物学的研究所。它也是一个文化和知识探索至关重要的地方，这种文化如今被如此虐待，以至于拥有一点点文化就足以让你显得无可救药地老派。这种知识越来越不愿展示，显得越发徒劳，因为它只保留给极少数精英。

我记得无数次在黑板前、午餐桌旁或咖啡时间进行的科学或其他话题的讨论。讨论总是有趣的，鲜有轻松的，话题涉及哲学、历史、文学、政治、宗教、教育或音乐（更不用说科学话题，那是理所当然的）。因为即使我遇到的大多数来自世界各地的数学家、理论物理学家或生物学家全身心投入研究，他们也是低调但才华横溢的人，通常非常有文化；他们保守但思想开放，批判但慷慨。

研究人员——俄罗斯人、中国人、印度人、美国人、非洲人、欧洲人——塑造了IHES的形象：一个进行最前沿理论科学研究的地方，也是一个培养人文精神、宽容和常常甚至是幻想破灭的世界观的地方；在这种世界观中，知识的发现构成了最终的成就。

再过几周，我将出国长期逗留。我将带着在IHES度过的数千小时的反思，几十条艰苦追寻的错误轨道，一些数学发现，还有数百次精彩的对话；换句话说，一笔取之不尽的财富。我也将带着，最重要的是，所有像我一样将寻求真理（在此情况下是科学真理）视为特权和最崇高的人类事业的研究人员的记忆。
——克里斯托弗·布鲁伊尔

## What Do Mathematicians Do?

There are several ways of doing mathematics. One of them, the one I want to describe, consists of attacking unresolved problems, those famous conjectures left aside by mathematicians who prefer to advance in their exploration of the un- known, leaving to others the task of checking the consequences of their theories. If the solution to these problems generally manages to get the theory moving and to enrich it, the motivation is usually more down to earth: the desire to be the first to find the solution to a problem, the pleasure of answering difficult questions, the satisfaction of realizing that several aspects in a field, which up till then seemed dissimilar, are in fact closely related.  
To resolve a problem is generally to prove
a result, that is to say, to explain with sufficient rigour and clarity why it is true. Here is an exam-
ple: draw a triangle whose vertexes you will call A,
B and C. Trace the mid perpendicular of the three sides, AB, BC and CA (the mid perpendicular of
a segment is the line which is perpendicular to it
and goes through the middle.) If you are careful
enough, you will find that the three straight lines
intersect at the same point. You will then be led
to conjecture that the mid perpendiculars of a
triangle are concurrent (this should remind some of you of your high school maths classes). How can we prove this? You can do algebra: give names to the coordinates of the three vertexes, then cal- culate the equations of the mid perpendiculars, then check that the three equations have the same solution. It is a perfectly valid proof, if your calcu- lations are detailed enough and your friends can redo them line by line and check that your conjec- ture is indeed true. That illustrates one aspect of mathematics: to prove is not to explain. Even if you follow the calculations line by line, you pro- bably still won’t understand why the result is true. Here is another proof which is more enlightening; it consists in trying to understand why the mid perpendiculars are special. The mid perpendicular of a segment AB is the sum of the points which are at the same distance from A and from B. In our triangle, the two mid perpendiculars AB and BC intersect at a point P which is equidistant from A and B (since it is on the first mid perpendicular) and equidistant from B and C (since it is on the second mid perpendicular) and therefore equidis- tant from C and A, so it is also on the third mid perpendicular, and therefore these three lines are indeed concurrent. When we look at things from the right angle, they become much simpler!
Let’s take now an example of a problem that no one knows how to solve. We start with a whole number n superior or equal to 1. If n is even, we divide it by 2, and if it is odd we replace it by 3n+1. For example, if we start with 13, then we come successively to 40, 20, 10, 5, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1. The problem is to show that whatever the number was to begin with, we always end up with 1. According to Wikipedia: “This conjecture mobilised mathe- maticians to such an extent during the 60s, in the middle of the cold war, that a joke went around that this problem was part of a Soviet plot to slow down research in America.” Good luck!
When you are faced with an unresolved pro-
blem, it’s like finding yourself up against a wall. You
start by banging on the wall in various places, in
the hope of finding a weak spot, a place where the
bricks don’t fit well and you can get at the masonry.
Often it resists, and so a long period of incerti-
tude and determination begins—mathematicians
are familiar with this—during which you try out
the tools which you possess, you use methods that
you know well and you try and understand what is
going on. As this is a fairly frustrating procedure,
it’s helpful to work on several problems at the same
time (often they shed light on each other), to dis-
cuss these questions with colleagues, and generally
to think about other things to stop the brain from overheating. After a more or less long period (a few
days, a few weeks, even a few months), one finally
makes progress. For example, you have treated a
particular case and it seems representative of the
general case, or maybe you have separated the pro-
98 blem into several different cases and some of these
seem feasible, or maybe you haven’t understood what’s going on but you have made lots of calcula- tions which seem to give the right answer. As soon as you have found a weak spot in the wall, you can attack it seriously, and the more you advance, the bigger the section of wall you can knock down.
We then move on to the second stage: we can see more or less what has to be done, and we have to write up our solution and check the details. Even if you have a general idea about how to prove a result, writing it down can reserve some surprises: you realize that a particular short-cut is in fact a trap, that a particular intermediate result is not strong enough, and you sometimes have the impression you’re trying to plug holes in a flimsy balloon filled with water; as soon as you have men- ded one hole, it starts to leak somewhere else! And if all the holes are too big, then you have to go back to the beginning. But as soon as you have plugged all the holes, then you can calmly finish your work and produce a solution as elegant as possible to the problem you had set yourself. And the conjecture is proved!
That is how some mathematicians work. But what does the mathematical community do? The object of a mathematician’s work is to understand mathematical phenomena and to synthesize the sum of knowledge that we have by unifying it, by finding the right way to look at things. The thou- sands of results that we prove every year serve to push back and mark out the boundaries of what is true. Then, stepping back, we can explain it in depth and integrate it into the permanent body of mathematical knowledge. To accomplish this work, everybody’s contribution counts. 

数学家在做什么？
有几种进行数学的方法，其中之一，我想描述的那种，就是攻击未解决的问题，那些被那些更喜欢在未知领域中探索的数学家搁置的著名猜想，把验证其理论结果的任务留给其他人。如果这些问题的解决通常能够推动理论的发展并丰富它，动机通常更接地气：希望成为第一个找到问题解决方案的人，回答困难问题的乐趣，意识到一个领域中几个看似不相关的方面实际上紧密相关的满足感。

解决一个问题通常是证明一个结果，即用足够的严谨性和清晰度解释它为何为真。这里有一个例子：画一个三角形，其顶点分别命名为A、B和C。画出三条边AB、BC和CA的中垂线（中垂线是指经过中点并垂直于该线段的直线）。如果你足够小心，你会发现这三条直线相交于同一点。你会因此推测三角形的中垂线是共点的（这应该让一些人想起高中数学课）。我们如何证明这一点呢？你可以做代数运算：给三角形三个顶点命名，然后计算中垂线的方程，检查这三个方程是否有相同的解。如果你的计算足够详细，你的朋友可以逐行重做这些计算，检查你的猜想是否确实成立，这就是一个完全有效的证明。这展示了数学的一个方面：证明并不是解释。即使你逐行跟随计算，你可能仍然不理解为什么结果是真的。这里有另一个更具启发性的证明；它试图理解为什么中垂线是特殊的。线段AB的中垂线是指距离A和B相等的点的集合。在我们的三角形中，两条中垂线AB和BC相交于一个点P，该点距离A和B相等（因为它在第一条中垂线上）且距离B和C相等（因为它在第二条中垂线上），因此也距离C和A相等，所以它也在第三条中垂线上，因此这三条直线确实是共点的。当我们从正确的角度看问题时，它们变得更简单了！

现在我们来看一个没人知道如何解决的问题。我们从一个大于或等于1的整数n开始。如果n是偶数，我们将它除以2，如果是奇数，我们将它替换为3n+1。例如，如果我们从13开始，我们依次得到40、20、10、5、16、8、4、2、1。问题是证明无论最初的数字是什么，我们总是以1结束。根据维基百科：“这个猜想在60年代冷战期间极大地动员了数学家，以至于有个笑话说这个问题是苏联拖慢美国研究的阴谋的一部分。”祝你好运！

当你面对一个未解决的问题时，就像遇到了一堵墙。你开始在各个地方敲打这堵墙，希望找到一个薄弱点，一个砖块没有很好契合的地方，你可以进入砖砌部分。它通常很坚固，因此一段长期的不确定和决心的时期开始了——数学家们对此很熟悉——在此期间你尝试使用你拥有的工具，使用你熟悉的方法，试图理解发生了什么。由于这是一个相当令人沮丧的过程，最好同时处理几个问题（它们通常互相启发），与同事讨论这些问题，并一般性地思考其他事情以防大脑过热。经过一个较长或较短的时期（几天、几周，甚至几个月），你终于取得进展。例如，你处理了一个特定的情况，它似乎代表了普遍情况，或者你把问题分成了几个不同的情况，其中一些似乎是可行的，或者你没有理解发生了什么，但你进行了很多计算，这些计算似乎给出了正确的答案。一旦你找到了墙上的一个薄弱点，你就可以认真攻击它，而且你越往前推进，你可以推倒的墙壁部分就越大。

然后我们进入第二阶段：我们或多或少知道该做什么，并且我们必须写出我们的解决方案并检查细节。即使你有一个关于如何证明结果的总体想法，写下来时可能会有一些惊喜：你意识到一个特定的捷径实际上是一个陷阱，一个特定的中间结果不够强，你有时会感觉你在试图堵住一个装满水的薄气球中的漏洞；一旦你堵住了一个漏洞，它就会在别的地方漏水！如果所有的漏洞都太大，那么你必须从头开始。但是一旦你堵住了所有的漏洞，你就可以冷静地完成你的工作，并为你设定的问题提供一个尽可能优雅的解决方案。猜想被证明了！

这就是一些数学家的工作方式。但数学界在做什么呢？数学家的工作对象是理解数学现象，并通过统一它们来综合我们所拥有的知识总和，通过找到看待事物的正确方法。我们每年证明的成千上万个结果用于推动和标记真实的边界。然后，退后一步，我们可以深入解释它并将其整合到数学知识的永久体中。为了完成这项工作，每个人的贡献都很重要。

## Fractalitas

Mathematics is like a treasure hunt with some dif- ferences. To begin with, it never ends. Solving the clues may bring more joy than finding a treasure. Moreover, there are infinitely many treasures and each of them is, at best, a clue for another hunt! In fact, mathematics may be more appropriately described as a fractal treasure hunt! 

Fractalitas

数学就像寻宝游戏，但有一些区别。首先，它永远不会结束。解决线索可能带来的乐趣比找到宝藏更多。此外，有无数的宝藏，它们中的每一个最多都是另一个狩猎的线索！事实上，数学更恰当地被描述为一个分形寻宝游戏！

## Mathematics, Biology and Neurobiology: A Profound Interaction
The interaction between physics and mathe- matics has been very fertile during the history of these two scientific disciplines. Mathematics furnishes the conceptual foundations and the for- mal methods for physics, and physics is a very rich source of problems and inspiration for ma- thematics. Newtonian mechanics motivated the development of infinitesimal calculus and the variational calculation of Euler; Riemannian geo- metry constitutes the foundation of the theory of general relativity; and more recently string theory has provoked profound repercussions in pure mathematics. The other sciences benefit from well-known analytic, numerical and statistical methods and set a number of difficult problems for applied mathematics, but without the pro- found interaction that is apparent in the case of physics.
Today, signs indicate that that may change. Given the spectacular experimental advances and enormous quantities of new data available, biology and neurobiology find themselves in a situation where, on the one hand, traditional formal and conceptual methods are no longer sufficient to understand the data, and on the
other hand, for the first time, we have a realistic
chance to understand living systems in all their
complexity. For mathematics this represents a
historic opportunity which could be extended to
the totality of their diverse approaches. Algebraic
methods are able to identify, systematise and
analyse discrete structures such as the gene or
the information, around which biological and
cognitive systems are organised, and to discover
the underlying structures using the enormous
quantities of biological and neurobiological data
which we have accumulated. Geometric concepts
help to explore the spatial organisation of biolo-
gical systems and can establish multidimensional relationships in abstract spaces. Mathematical analysis is indispensable for studying, modelizing and simulating deterministic or stochastic dyna- mics of a cell or of a neuronal network.
The IHES has played a decisive role in the development of pure mathematics for fifty years. Its vast experience in nearly all areas of mathe- matics gives it a unique opportunity to make in-depth progress in the totally new direction which research on biological and cognitive sys- tems has initiated.

数学、生物学和神经生物学：深刻的互动
物理学和数学之间的互动在这两个科学学科的历史中非常丰富。数学为物理学提供了概念基础和形式方法，而物理学则为数学提供了丰富的问题和灵感来源。牛顿力学推动了微积分和欧拉变分法的发展的；黎曼几何学构成了广义相对论的基础；更近的弦理论在纯数学中引起了深远的影响。其他科学从众所周知的分析、数值和统计方法中受益，并为应用数学设定了一些难题，但没有物理学中那种深刻的互动。

今天，有迹象表明情况可能会改变。由于实验的显著进展和大量新数据的可用性，生物学和神经生物学发现自己处于一种传统的形式和概念方法不再足以理解数据的情况下，而另一方面，我们首次有现实的机会去理解所有其复杂性的生物系统。对于数学来说，这是一个历史性的机会，可以扩展到其多样化的方法。代数方法能够识别、系统化和分析离散结构，如基因或信息，这些是生物和认知系统组织的基础，并使用我们积累的大量生物和神经生物学数据发现潜在结构。几何概念帮助探索生物系统的空间组织，并能够在抽象空间中建立多维关系。数学分析对于研究、建模和模拟细胞或神经网络的确定性或随机动态是必不可少的。

IHES在纯数学的发展中发挥了决定性作用已有五十年。它在几乎所有数学领域的广泛经验使其在生物和认知系统研究所启动的全新方向上取得深入进展成为可能。

## Mathematics in the Biological Sciences

When I was a graduate student I was confronted
with the following choice: continue with mathe-
matical physics or go to the University of Chicago
and do a doctorate in mathematical biology. In
those days hardly anybody with a theoretical bent
thought to do anything but the physical or ma- thematical sciences. However, apart from regular
science courses, I had taken courses in philosophy
and psychology and in the latter I’d had my in-
terest aroused in neuroscience—neurons seemed
more relevant to human behaviour than neu-
trons! I also had the book Embodiments of Mind
by McCulloch and it seemed that studying the
brain would be a fascinating thing to do. I had
seen that Nicolas Rashevsky was editor of Bulletin
of Mathematical Biophysics, which prompted me
to apply to Chicago, where he had started the
first mathematical biology program in the U.S.
My mathematical physics professors in Australia
wished me well, although I could tell they were sceptical—I was very surprised when they later turned to research in Theoretical Neurobiology
I thus ventured to Chicago where I found out
that Rashevsky, an immigrant from Russia,had
104 been removed for being politically incorrect. I took my first course in probability from Patrick Billingsley—he was a very jovial person and I thought he could hardly be a serious scholar, as he kept saying “OK?” at the end of every other sentence. Later I found out that he had written the fundamental book on weak convergence. I became interested in stochastic processes and became absorbed in the works of Ito, Kolmogorov and other Russian probabilists.
Mathematics in biology prior to about 1960 could be summarized in a few short paragraphs. The legacy of three centuries of theoretical phy- sics was that nearly all linear problems could be solved, at least in principle. Unfortunately bio- logy for the most part has not cooperated and requires non-elementary mathematics for most of its theories. The start of theoretical population biology was probably Malthus’s essay in 1797 on exponential growth and his forecast of the end of the world by overpopulation. Branching processes had been introduced as early as 1873 by Galton and Watson. There had been significant advances in mathematical genetics in the early part of the 20th century—beginning with Wright and Fisher, as they put Darwinian ideas into mathematical form. I read that Darwin regretted not having had
a better grasp of mathematical ideas. Hardy, who
scorned applied mathematics, became famous, pro-
bably to his chagrin, for the Hardy-Weinberg law
in population genetics, which is regarded by some
as the Newtonian first law of genetics. Diffusion
processes (probabilistic) had been employed by
Wright as early as 1930, although it was not until
many years later that mathematicians like Ito, Kolmogorov and Feller made the subject rigorous. In a similar way Fisher had proposed his partial differential equation for gene spread as early as 1937, but reaction-diffusion systems were not stu- died much by mathematicians until much later. Other pioneering influential works in mathema- tical biology were the Lotka-Volterra equations, Kermack and McKendrick’s papers on epidemics
in the 1920s,and Turing’s model for morphoge-
nesis in 1951. Schrödinger in 1944 also entered
the fray with his popular lectures and book What
Is Life?, where he proposed that genetic material
was molecular. This is supposed to have guided
Watson and Crick in their discovery of the role
of DNA. In brain theory, the extremely talented mathematician Wiener had done pioneering work in cybernetics and the remarkable Von Neumann had also made contributions.
I taught a course in theoretical neurobiology at UCLA in 1980 and later Cambridge published a two-volume work based on the course. At that time I thought they would not get much use, but in the next 10 to15 years they became widely used as textbooks in diverse departments throughout the world. While researching material for the course I found that Lapicque had devised a commonly used neuron model in 1907, which many people have since written about. Physicists took up the subject with enthusiasm after Hopfield presented his sim- ple yet powerful neural network model in 1982. Today the number of neuroscience-orientated articles in mathematics, physics and many other journals is immense—so much so that it is hard to keep abreast of the literature, unlike when I was a graduate student.Computer scientists have also became involved in large numbers in studying the brain and artificial intelligence. Some researchers are modeling whole brains and including every neuron, just as others are modeling whole countries with every member of the population in epidemio- logical studies! According to a recent review by the American Association for the Advancement of Science, “Opportunities for quantitative thinking about biological systems are exploding”. One can’t help but agree and wonder how things will be at the end of the 21st century and beyond.

数学在生物科学中的应用
当我还是研究生时，我面临以下选择：继续从事数学物理学研究或前往芝加哥大学攻读数学生物学博士学位。在那个时代，几乎没有任何有理论倾向的人会考虑做除物理或数学科学以外的事情。然而，除了常规的科学课程外，我还选修了哲学和心理学课程，并且在后者中我对神经科学产生了兴趣——神经元似乎比中子更与人类行为相关！我还有一本McCulloch的书《心灵的体现》，它似乎表明研究大脑将是一件非常有趣的事情。我看到Nicolas Rashevsky是《数学生物物理学公报》的编辑，这促使我申请芝加哥大学，他在那里创办了美国第一个数学生物学项目。我的数学物理教授们在澳大利亚祝我好运，尽管我能看出他们有些怀疑——令我非常惊讶的是，他们后来转向了理论神经生物学的研究。

于是我冒险来到芝加哥，发现Rashevsky，这位来自俄罗斯的移民，因为政治上的不正确被除名。我上的第一门概率课程是Patrick Billingsley教的——他是一个非常开朗的人，我以为他不可能是个严肃的学者，因为他每隔一句话就说“好吧？”后来我发现他写了关于弱收敛的基础书籍。我对随机过程产生了兴趣，并沉浸在Ito、Kolmogorov和其他俄罗斯概率论学者的著作中。

1960年前的数学生物学可以用几段简短的段落总结。三世纪的理论物理学遗产是几乎所有线性问题至少在原理上都可以解决。不幸的是，生物学大多不合作，对于其大多数理论需要非基本的数学。理论人口生物学的开始可能是1797年Malthus关于指数增长的文章及其对世界因人口过剩而终结的预测。分枝过程早在1873年由Galton和Watson引入。在20世纪初期数学遗传学取得了重大进展——始于Wright和Fisher，他们将达尔文的思想形式化为数学形式。我读到达尔文后悔没有更好地掌握数学思想。鄙视应用数学的Hardy，因Hardy-Weinberg遗传平衡定律而闻名，这被某些人视为遗传学的牛顿第一定律。Wright早在1930年就使用了扩散过程（概率论），尽管直到许多年后Ito、Kolmogorov和Feller等数学家才使这一主题严谨化。同样，Fisher早在1937年就提出了他的基因扩散的偏微分方程，但反应-扩散系统直到很久以后才被数学家们广泛研究。其他在数学生物学中具有开创性影响的工作包括Lotka-Volterra方程、Kermack和McKendrick在20世纪20年代关于流行病的论文以及1951年Turing的形态发生模型。1944年，Schrödinger也通过他的热门讲座和书籍《生命是什么？》加入了战斗，他在书中提出遗传物质是分子。据说这引导了Watson和Crick发现DNA的作用。在大脑理论方面，极有才华的数学家Wiener在控制论领域做了开创性的工作，而杰出的Von Neumann也做出了贡献。

1980年，我在加州大学洛杉矶分校教授了一门理论神经生物学课程，后来剑桥大学出版了一本基于该课程的两卷本著作。那时我以为它们不会被广泛使用，但在接下来的10到15年里，它们在世界各地的不同部门广泛用作教材。在为课程研究材料时，我发现Lapicque早在1907年就设计了一个常用的神经元模型，许多人后来对此进行了研究。1982年，Hopfield提出了他简单但强大的神经网络模型后，物理学家们热情地投入这一领域。今天，在数学、物理学和许多其他期刊中，神经科学导向的文章数量庞大——如此之多，以至于很难跟上文献的步伐，不像我在研究生时期那样。计算机科学家们也大量参与到研究大脑和人工智能中。一些研究人员正在模拟整个大脑，包括每一个神经元，就像其他人在流行病学研究中模拟整个国家的每一个成员一样！根据美国科学促进会最近的一篇评论，“关于生物系统的定量思维机会正在爆炸式增长”。你不能不同意并想知道在21世纪末及以后情况会如何。

## The Unravelers

The title of this book describes mathemati- cians with a simple and effective word: “The Unravelers”. It is then left to the mathematicians
a more refined elaboration on why they have been portrayed this way and why they have chosen to dedicate their professional lives and devote their intellectual energies to unraveling the mysteries of mathematics. One may wonder why, for example,
the pleasure of pursuing studies in mathematics prevails in some human mind over the dedication
to other sciences or arts. Of course, each mathe- matician has his/her own personal explanation
and life experience. This choice sometimes roots back to the childhood or early youth: it can be attributed either to a stimulating intellectual at- mosphere in the family or to a clever and unusual introduction to mathematics at school or else to a circle of friends with a common point of conver- gence in intellectual discussions...
In fact, one could also phrase these ques-
tions by asking why some of us are particularly
receptive to the mathematical logic or even more
suggestively phrased to ask why some people
“listen” to mathematics with a sensitivity that is
still rarely understood while it would be much more easily appreciated if the subject of such attention had been, for example, music. After all, there are deep connections linking mathematics and music, everybody knows it. One could date them back to the ancient Greece culture that was fascinated equally by harmony and numbers. It is quite frequent to meet mathematicians with a refined musical taste that is expressed either in the form of playing satisfactorily an instrument or in the form of a cultivated theoretical knowledge. Mathematics and music are intimately related: both sciences are concerned with structures and the creation of new patterns out of what is pre- sented to us at the beginning.
In mathematics we invent theories that are abstract organizations of a multitude of cases. We speak of beauty in a mathematical argument when our effort to create new patterns is rewar- ded by the discovery of hidden new relations that we have never seen before and in which we recognize an intrinsic symmetry and possibly a new and unexpected link to a different branch. Artistic creativity is a common quality shared by a composer and a mathematician, and it includes frequently unpredictable elements, moments of frustration and depression which alternate with moments of emotional excitement and happi- ness. This is the wild side of any creative work of art and science, and in mathematics it coexists with our search for order and rationality.
I think that the term “unravelers” will please many professional mathematicians because it implicitly refers to the mental tension and the experience of comprehension that accompanies us in our work, at every moment of mathemati- cal creativity, whether we are alone at our desks or when we expose our mathematical results at a conference, or when we exchange, among col- leagues, our latest viewpoint on a theory at a research institute. 

解开谜团的人
本书的标题用一个简单而有效的词语描述了数学家：“解开谜团的人”。然后留给数学家们更精细地阐述为什么他们被这样描述，以及为什么他们选择将职业生涯和智力精力奉献给解开数学的奥秘。人们可能会想知道，为什么例如，追求数学研究的乐趣在某些人心中胜过对其他科学或艺术的奉献。当然，每个数学家都有他/她自己的个人解释和生活经历。这种选择有时可以追溯到童年或青年时期：它可以归因于家庭中的激励性智力氛围，或是学校里对数学的巧妙和非凡的介绍，或者是朋友圈中的共同智力讨论点.

事实上，人们还可以通过问为什么我们中的一些人对数学逻辑特别敏感来提出这些问题，或者更有启发性地问为什么有些人“倾听”数学的敏感性仍然很少被理解，而如果这种注意力的对象是音乐，它将更容易被欣赏。毕竟，数学和音乐之间有深刻的联系，人人皆知。可以追溯到古希腊文化，那时人们同样对和谐与数字着迷。经常遇到具有高雅音乐品味的数学家，这种品味要么表现为令人满意的乐器演奏，要么表现为有修养的理论知识。数学和音乐是紧密相关的：两者都关心结构，并从我们一开始所呈现的东西中创造新的模式。

在数学中，我们发明理论，这些理论是对大量案例的抽象组织。当我们努力创造新模式并通过发现以前从未见过的隐藏新关系而获得回报时，我们会称数学论证为美丽，在这些关系中我们识别出一种内在的对称性，并可能与不同分支建立新的意想不到的联系。艺术创造力是作曲家和数学家共有的品质，它通常包含不可预测的元素，挫折和沮丧的时刻交替出现，与情绪兴奋和幸福的时刻交替出现。这是任何艺术和科学创作工作的狂野一面，在数学中，它与我们对秩序和理性的追求共存。

我认为“解开谜团的人”这个词会让许多职业数学家感到满意，因为它隐含地提到了伴随我们工作中的心理紧张和理解体验，在每一个数学创造的时刻，无论是我们独自坐在书桌前，还是在会议上展示我们的数学成果，或在研究所与同事交流我们对一个理论的最新看法。

## Long Live the Machine

It all started because I love machines. I am fasci- nated by the mere idea of having a robot at hand, so refined that one can give it orders of increasing complexity and it will carry out the required task, no matter how sophisticated it may be. Nowadays that seems perfectly ordinary, but in the begin- ning it was a miracle.
It was in 1963—I was still a student with a sum-
mer grant at the Lawrence Livermore Laboratory
in California—that I had my first contact with
computers. It wasn’t easy: to begin with, only a
few privileged people had access to the machines,
and if you wanted to programme a machine you
first had to write out your programme by hand,
then give it to a lady who typed it out on a per-
forated card that was fed into the slot, etc. It was
practically the first transistorised computer (before
they worked with lamps, which functioned for a
few hours then overheated and burned out...)
which cost several millions of dollars and which
only a few selected researchers had access to. I was
totally obsessed, to the despair of my wife, who
would see me go off at 8 in the morning and come 
back at 11 o’clock in the evening. However, these machines weren’t adapted to the type of problems which interested me, and I finally gave up.
But my enthusiasm was still there and since the ’70s, my mathematics has been related to compu- ters. In fact, it was really here at the IHES that everything started, when Louis Michel ordered a particularly elaborate, programmable desktop computer. It was a revolution! Before, if you wan- ted to do computer studies seriously, you had to go through enormous computer centres where you were completely cut off from the machines them- selves and where the delays were very long. So this little personal computer that you could consult directly using BASIC language was a miracle. I was convinced that the computer could be to the brain what the bicycle is to the body, a means to multiply the possibilities. And like a bicycle, a desktop computer remains on a human scale. I’ve always had a problem with gigantic, super- calculators. At the same time I was in Berkeley, where a new mathematics and computer studies building was going up. As often, where building is concerned, there was plenty of money and there was enough left over to buy a powerful interactive minicomputer. With its advantages and inconve- niences, compared with the Hewlett-Packard of the IHES, it was the second cause which determi- ned my future engagement. 
At the beginning of the ’70s, at the IHES,
David Ruelle had developed some interesting ideas
on turbulence in relation to the theory of dyna-
mic systems, which gave rise to some very simple
models that one could easily display on a compu-
ter. Of course, we could have done it without the
computer, but what a lot of effort it saved us! The decisive moment took place at the end of the ’70s with the work of Feigenbaum on universality and renormalization groups applied to the iteration of simple functions. He noticed that certain num- bers from certain types of systems present striking resemblances. Studying this, he made formidable progress in the understanding of the theory of dynamic systems. All of that thanks to the com- puter and to the purely accidental discovery that two different systems produce similar numbers.
These days, everything has changed. I am again immersed in an exciting project in nume- rical computation close to the theory of dynamic systems, and I continue to marvel like a child at the progress of the machines and the software, always more powerful, more adaptable, easier to use, smaller, cheaper and which, in addition to doing purely scientific calculations, henceforth dominate, through the visual aspect, all areas of communication.
However, I cannot help regretting the passing of those heroic days. I have the impression that today the simple questions have been solved and that even if there is still gold to be found, one has to dig deeper.... I, myself, was lucky to have been caught up in this movement from the beginning, at a miraculous moment: the facts were there, they were simply waiting for us to be able to dis- cover them. 

## 机器万岁

一切的起因是我热爱机器。我被手边有一个机器人这个想法所迷住，它如此精密，可以给它下达越来越复杂的指令，而它将执行所需的任务，无论多么复杂。如今这似乎再普通不过了，但在最初的时候，这简直是奇迹。

那是在1963年——我还是加利福尼亚州劳伦斯利弗莫尔实验室的一个拿着暑期奖学金的学生——那时我第一次接触到了计算机。这并不容易：首先，只有少数特权人士才能接触到这些机器，如果你想编写程序，首先要手写程序，然后交给一个女士，她把程序打到穿孔卡上，这张卡被插入机器的插槽等。这几乎是第一台晶体管计算机（之前的计算机使用电子管，工作几个小时后会过热烧坏……）它价值数百万美元，只有少数精选的研究人员可以使用。我完全着迷了，这让我的妻子很绝望，她看到我早上8点出门，晚上11点回来。然而，这些机器并不适合我感兴趣的问题，最终我放弃了。

但我的热情依然存在，从70年代开始，我的数学研究与计算机紧密相关。实际上，一切真正开始是在IHES（高等科学研究所），当时Louis Michel订购了一台特别复杂、可编程的台式计算机。这是一场革命！以前，如果你想认真做计算机研究，你必须通过庞大的计算中心，在那里你完全与机器本身隔绝，延迟时间也很长。所以这台可以用BASIC语言直接操作的小型个人计算机简直是个奇迹。我坚信计算机对于大脑来说就像自行车对于身体，是一种扩展可能性的手段。像自行车一样，台式计算机保持在人类尺度上。我一直对巨大的超级计算机有意见。与此同时，我在伯克利，那里正在建造一座新的数学和计算机研究大楼。通常在建筑方面有充足的资金，还有足够的钱购买一台强大的互动式小型计算机。与IHES的惠普计算机相比，它有其优点和缺点，这是决定我未来参与的第二个原因。

70年代初，在IHES，David Ruelle在与动力系统理论相关的湍流方面提出了一些有趣的想法，这产生了一些可以在计算机上轻松显示的非常简单的模型。当然，我们可以不用计算机来做，但它为我们节省了大量的努力！决定性时刻发生在70年代末，Feigenbaum在普遍性和重整化群应用于简单函数迭代的工作中取得了进展。他注意到某些类型系统的某些数字存在惊人的相似之处。研究这个问题，他在理解动力系统理论方面取得了巨大进展。所有这些都得益于计算机和偶然发现的两个不同系统产生相似数字。

如今，一切都变了。我再次沉浸在一个与动力系统理论密切相关的数值计算项目中，我继续像孩子一样对机器和软件的进步感到惊奇，越来越强大、适应性更强、更易于使用、更小、更便宜，除了进行纯科学计算之外，现在还通过视觉方面主导了所有的交流领域。

然而，我不禁怀念那些英雄般的日子。我觉得今天简单的问题已经解决了，即使仍有黄金可挖，但需要更深地挖掘……我自己很幸运，从一开始就参与到这个运动中，在一个奇迹般的时刻：事实就在那儿，只等着我们去发现。

## Arriving in Paradise
114
Usually, the life of a scientist is not an easy life, and to remain sane, it is good to be honest about this fact, and sometimes to reflect on what has gone well and what has not gone so well. Scientists who work on important, challenging problems all reach their limits, sooner or later, and are confronted with the experience of failure and of being bea- ten by colleagues, or rescued by collaborators. The question is how one copes with such experiences.
I was a pretty good student, because I could
easily learn things by following my teachers’ expositions at a blackboard or discussing with my
fellow students, always willing to imagine that I
might be able to do at least as well as they did.
Most of the time, books do not catch my atten-
tion; having to work through exercises proposed
by a teacher, in competition with many other stu-
dents, usually represented a challenge I was eager
to take on, and I was quite good at it. Learning
new things from books works for me, in cases
when I have to prepare lectures that force me to
learn those new things and translate them into
simple prose. Glancing through some of my old
papers, I realize that I would never have learnt
physics properly if I had never had to teach it.
I have missed a good many opportunities to work on certain interesting scientific problems, not because I could not see them, but because I was convinced that I wouldn’t be able to solve them successfully. This is one reason why I always liked to collaborate with other people. When one gets stuck on a problem it is comforting to know that one’s collaborators may also be stuck. It is comforting if they then find a way out of the dea- dlock, and it is challenging to try to do at least as well as one’s collaborators. I find it difficult to endure the loneliness of a desk in an empty office. This is why my office is messy, and why I usually don’t work in my office; I work when sitting at a table or standing in front of a blackboard and dis- cussing with colleagues or students, or by writing letters to collaborators.
When I think back on all the different places where I have spent my professional life, arriving in Bures was like arriving in Paradise. First of all I had excellent colleagues, permanent professors like David Ruelle, or visitors like Tom Spencer, Henri Epstein, Krzysztof Gawedzki, Elliott Lieb, Barry Simon, David Brydges, Erhard Seiler, Bergfinnur Durhuus, Carlos Aragão de Carvalho, Sergio Caracciolo, Alan Sokal (now a famous philosopher), and others. Never before and never afterwards was the atmosphere among colleagues so cheerful and friendly. What’s more, most of the time, I could do what I liked. While I very much like not to be told what to do, such a situa- tion of complete liberty would soon have become a nightmare for me if I had not had the good fortune of having absolutely marvelous collabo- rators, who kept me focused, almost during our entire stay at Bures.
The magicians at the Institute were the mathe- maticians. Pierre Deligne and Dennis Sullivan appeared to be able to pull fantastic mathema-
tics out of their hats or out of thin air. Dennis
was especially magical—I have seen him struggle
with calculating the first derivative of an elemen-
tary function during lunch. But then he would
create those visions of how to solve problems
like the Feigenbaum problem, avoiding tedious calculations and instead relying on powerful geometrical-topological intuition. I admired
his lectures, with his anti-Bourbaki style. Proofs
occasionally consisted of rhythmic motions of
his arms accompanied by unidentifiable noises. I
also enjoyed the company of Alain Connes, who
then still had time to discuss and to socialize.
I attended his lectures introducing cyclic coho-
mology. Daniel Kastler patiently tried to explain
the details of “les idées d’Alain” to me. He was
Alain’s prophet. My office at the Institute was
located next to a little seminar. On Saturday
mornings, when I tried to catch up with all the
work that could not be done during the week,
I would hear the sound of the lecturer in René
Thom’s seminar about applications of catastro-phe theory. Lecturers in his seminar included mathematicians, physicists, biologists, tailors, linguists, philosophers, etc. “Anything appea- red to go” in this somewhat postmodern circle. I hardly ever attended them. I believed in what Richard Feynman has expressed in the following sentence: “It’s not philosophy we are after, but the behavior of real things.”
Theoretical and mathematical physics have proved to be extraordinarily rich sources of good problems in mathematics, and mathema- tics was recognized already by Galileo Galilei as the language in which the Book of Nature is written. It is useful to institutionalize a dialogue between mathematicians and physicists, as it happens at the IHES. This dialogue has proved to be very useful for both mathematicians and physicists, including ones working there. (Ruelle and Sullivan have done important joint work, Connes and Damour have coauthored a paper, Connes has collaborated with Kreimer and is working with Chamseddine, etc.)
Mathematical physics is a very useful endea- vor in two kinds of periods: first, during periods when progress in discovering new Laws of Nature is stagnating, so that one can take time to conso- lidate what previous generations have discovered and to study new “emergent phenomena” within already existing conceptual frameworks and theories. Such attempts tend to be intrinsically rather mathematical. Examples are celestial mechanics during the times of Hamilton and Poincaré, theories of the onset of turbulence, or renormalization theory, or concrete problems in quantum mechanics, statistical mechanics and transport theory, etc.
Second, mathematical physics is useful in
times when deep conceptual problems are tur-
ning up which call for a radical rethinking of
the foundations of physical theory and for new mathematical tools. The times when the mathe- matical formulations of electrodynamics and statistical mechanics were found, in the nine- teenth century, represent an example. Maxwell
and Boltzmann were mathematical physicists in
every respect. The period from 1900 till 1926,
when quantum mechanics and the relativity theo-
ries were discovered and atomism was vindicated,
is an even better example. Einstein, Schrödinger,
Dirac, Pauli, Born and others were mathemati-
cal physicists in the best sense. It is important
to stress that our generation too is facing a deep conceptual problem—one that has confronted
all generations of theorists for the past seventy
years: the unification of quantum theory with general relativity in a new theory of space, time
and matter. This problem has proved to be so difficult and thorny that real progress has been
very slow, and a definitive solution is not yet in
sight.
The success of a mathematical physicist is not
measured in the number of theorems he or she
has proved, but in his or her ability to compre-
hend the famous “behavior of real things” in a
mathematically precise way. There is excellent
mathematical physics involving insights that can-
not be formulated as rigorous mathematics, at least
not yet. But there is also a brand of mathematical
physics that brings forward new theorems, as well
as new insights into physical phenomena. I have
tried to do both things, with varying success. I
feel one has to try to adapt one’s style and one’s
methods of attack to the problems one wishes to solve. Prejudices concerning style, technique and methods tend to hamper progress. Generally speaking, I don’t think it is a good idea to try to see all problems from a single “unifying”point of view or through the lens of only one mathema- tical theory.
Thus, I have worked on rather many different problems in various areas of theoretical physics. On a few occasions, I have even managed to provide some theoretical interpretation of pheno- mena observed in the laboratories of colleagues in experimental physics.
I use mathematics in an eclectic way and usually do not attempt to create new mathema- tical tools, but rather try to use existing ones. I like to invent physical problems and then sketch
how one might want to attack them mathemati-
cally. The period when one doesn’t know how to proceed further in really solving them and when
one has to try out lots of alternative strategies, get
stuck and find a way out of a deadlock, when one
has to do lots of calculations, and so on; this is
the period that often loses me, unless I am helped
by competent collaborators. Generally speaking,
I don’t believe in visions, but I like to develop
views and opinions, including strong ones, and change them whenever compelled to do so. I tend
to think that good theories, physical and mathe-
matical ones, grow on the ground of really good,
relevant, concrete problems and, once they are
created, help in solving these problems.
It appears to the outsider that many of the young string theorists hardly ever do anything but solve rather concrete and technically very deman- ding problems. It may seem that they share my opinion that good theories, such as a “quantum theory of space, time and matter”, will emerge only from the solution of very many concrete, hard problems. The problem is that, most of the time, they don’t appear to solve problems deeply rooted in physics, nor do they solve problems of relevance for progress in mathematics—however, some do, sometimes. The situation reminds me somewhat of the one during the later days of the old Bohr-Sommerfeld-Epstein quantum theory, before Heisenberg, Schrödinger and Dirac came along. So it may be that, at present, they are not creating more than the background sound out of which the sound of a flute or violin or harp will emerge, announcing a breakthrough in attempts to create a quantum (or whatever) theory of space, time and matter. We don’t know when this will happen, but that background sound may help to keep us focused.
To conclude, my experience as a physicist has been that there are lots of different ways to be successful in physics. We should have respect for people who make other choices that don’t work for us but may work for them. What counts in the end is to remain intellectually honest and to be able to lead a decent and enjoyable life.

## 抵达天堂

通常，科学家的生活并不容易。为了保持理智，坦率地面对这一事实是好的，有时也要反思哪些事情进展顺利，哪些不太顺利。研究重要而富有挑战性问题的科学家迟早都会遇到极限，面临失败的经历，被同事击败或被合作者拯救。问题在于如何应对这些经历。

我曾是一个相当优秀的学生，因为我能通过跟随老师在黑板上的讲解或与同学讨论轻松地学习。大多数时候，书本并不能吸引我；与许多其他学生竞争完成老师布置的练习，通常代表了我渴望接受的挑战，我在这方面表现得很好。从书本中学习新知识对我来说有效，特别是在需要准备讲座、必须学习新知识并将其转化为简单语言时。翻看一些旧论文，我意识到如果没有教授物理学，我就永远不会真正学会它。

我错过了许多机会来研究某些有趣的科学问题，不是因为我看不到这些问题，而是因为我确信自己无法成功解决它们。这是我总是喜欢与他人合作的一个原因。当一个人陷入困境时，知道自己的合作者也可能陷入困境是一种安慰。如果他们找到了解决困境的方法，那也是一种激励，让我尝试至少做得和合作者一样好。我发现难以忍受在空办公室里独自工作的孤独。这就是为什么我的办公室凌乱，为什么我通常不在办公室工作；我喜欢坐在桌子旁或站在黑板前与同事或学生讨论，或给合作者写信。

回顾我职业生涯中待过的不同地方，抵达布雷斯（Bures）就像抵达了天堂。首先，我有出色的同事，如David Ruelle，或像Tom Spencer, Henri Epstein, Krzysztof Gawedzki, Elliott Lieb, Barry Simon, David Brydges, Erhard Seiler, Bergfinnur Durhuus, Carlos Aragão de Carvalho, Sergio Caracciolo, Alan Sokal（现已是著名哲学家）等来访的教授。之前和之后，同行之间的氛围从未如此欢乐和友好。此外，大多数时候，我可以做自己喜欢的事。虽然我很喜欢不被告知该做什么，但如果没有绝妙的合作者让我保持专注，这种完全自由的情况很快就会变成我的噩梦，几乎在我们整个布雷斯期间都是如此。

研究所的魔术师是数学家。Pierre Deligne和Dennis Sullivan似乎能从帽子里或空气中变出神奇的数学。Dennis特别神奇——我曾见过他在午餐时为计算一个基本函数的一阶导数而挣扎。但随后他会创造出如何解决像Feigenbaum问题的解决方案，避免繁琐的计算，而依赖于强大的几何拓扑直觉。我佩服他的讲座，他的反布尔巴基风格。证明有时仅由他的手臂的节奏性动作和难以辨识的声音组成。我也喜欢Alain Connes的陪伴，那时他还有时间讨论和社交。我参加了他介绍循环上同调的讲座。Daniel Kastler耐心地向我解释“Alain的想法”的细节。他是Alain的传道者。我的办公室就在一个小型研讨会旁边。周六早上，当我试图赶上那些在一周内无法完成的工作时，我会听到René Thom关于灾变理论应用的研讨会讲师的声音。研讨会的讲师包括数学家、物理学家、生物学家、裁缝、语言学家、哲学家等。在这个有些后现代的圈子里，似乎什么都可以。我几乎从未参加过这些研讨会。我相信Richard Feynman所说的一句话：“我们追求的不是哲学，而是实际事物的行为。”

理论和数学物理学已经证明是数学问题的极其丰富的来源，Galileo Galilei早已认识到数学是“自然之书”所写的语言。将数学家和物理学家的对话制度化是有用的，如在IHES发生的那样。这种对话被证明对数学家和物理学家都非常有用，包括在那里的研究人员。（Ruelle和Sullivan进行过重要的联合工作，Connes和Damour合著了一篇论文，Connes与Kreimer合作过，现在正在与Chamseddine合作等。）

在两种时期，数学物理学是非常有用的努力：首先，在发现自然新规律的进展停滞时期，可以利用时间巩固前几代人发现的成果，并在现有的概念框架和理论中研究新的“涌现现象”。这些尝试往往本质上是相当数学化的。例子有Hamilton和Poincaré时期的天体力学，湍流理论的开始，重整化理论，或者量子力学、统计力学和输运理论中的具体问题等。

其次，在深刻的概念问题出现，需要对物理理论的基础进行根本性重新思考并需要新数学工具的时期。十九世纪电动力学和统计力学的数学表述的发现是一个例子。Maxwell和Boltzmann在各方面都是数学物理学家。从1900年到1926年量子力学和相对论的发现以及原子论的验证时期是一个更好的例子。Einstein、Schrödinger、Dirac、Pauli、Born等人在最好的意义上都是数学物理学家。重要的是强调我们的这一代也面临一个深刻的概念问题——过去七十年来所有理论家都面临的问题：在一个新的空间、时间和物质理论中统一量子理论和广义相对论。这个问题被证明是如此困难和棘手，以至于真正的进展非常缓慢，尚未有一个最终解决方案。

数学物理学家的成功不在于他或她证明了多少定理，而在于他或她是否能够以数学上精确的方式理解著名的“实际事物的行为”。有些出色的数学物理学涉及到的见解尚不能表述为严格的数学，至少目前还不能。但也有一种数学物理学提出了新的定理，以及对物理现象的新见解。我试图做这两件事，成功与否有所不同。我觉得一个人必须尝试根据自己希望解决的问题来调整自己的风格和攻击方法。关于风格、技术和方法的偏见往往会阻碍进步。一般来说，我不认为从单一的“统一”观点或仅通过一种数学理论的镜头看所有问题是个好主意。

因此，我在理论物理学的各个领域研究了很多不同的问题。在少数情况下，我甚至设法为实验物理学同事的实验现象提供了一些理论解释。

我以一种折衷的方式使用数学，通常不试图创建新的数学工具，而是尝试使用现有的工具。我喜欢发明物理问题，然后勾勒出如何用数学方法解决这些问题的思路。在不确定如何进一步解决它们的时期，我们必须尝试许多替代策略，陷入困境并找到解决困境的方法，进行大量计算等等；这个时期常常让我迷失，除非有称职的合作者帮助我。一般来说，我不相信直觉，但我喜欢发展看法和意见，包括强烈的看法，并在必要时改变它们。我倾向于认为好的理论，无论是物理的还是数学的，都是在真正好的、相关的、具体的问题的基础上发展起来的，一旦它们被创建，就能帮助解决这些问题。

外界看来，许多年轻的弦理论家几乎只解决一些非常具体和技术上非常艰难的问题。看起来他们似乎也认同我的观点，即“空间、时间和物质的量子理论”等好理论只能从解决许多具体、艰难的问题中产生。问题是，大多数时候，他们似乎并没有解决物理学深处的问题，也没有解决对数学进步有意义的问题——不过，有时他们会。这种情况让我想起旧的玻尔-索末菲尔德-爱普斯坦量子理论后期的情景，在海森堡、薛定谔和狄拉克出现之前。所以，可能目前他们只是在创造背景噪音，而从中会出现长笛、小提琴或竖琴的声音，宣布在创建空间、时间和物质的量子（或其他）理论方面取得突破。我们不知道这会何时发生，但这种背景噪音可能有助于让我们保持专注。

总之，我作为物理学家的经验是，有很多不同的方式可以在物理学中取得成功。我们应该尊重那些做出与我们不同选择的人，这些选择可能对我们不起作用，但对他们起作用。最终重要的是保持知识上的诚实，并能够过上体面和愉快的生活。

## Go to the  Board!

You can talk mathematics up to a point, then words are no longer enough. So you get out your pen; a formula scribbled on the tablecloth or on a metro ticket can help to sort out the problem and set the conversation rolling again. When the exchange becomes more stimulating and the for- mulas start to crowd each other out on the little scrap of paper, you get up, and out comes the chalk. It’s the blackboard, formerly so threatening in one’s schooldays, yet now so familiar, which comes to the rescue. There, you can get to grips with mathematics; you scribble, rub out, write over the top, and an as yet wobbly construction of ideas is elaborated of which only a few tra- ces remain on the board. For the sponge does its job, threatening to wipe out the white characters which shyly creep across the board. After each vigorous wipe a big, damp stretch relentlessly co- vers those which survived the preceding wash.
Silence, calm; one puts the sponge down, looks at the formulas that remain. A few steps back to gauge, evaluate, admire a formula, a pro- position, a proof still in the making.... A state of grace for the ephemeral scribblings still on the blackboard. The slightest comment, a question,
however tentative, may make the few surviving
sentences, formulas or symbols disappear forever.
So, you meditate....
Finally, the eyes which up till then were sta-
ring at the board glance at each other, shining,
satisfied, sated; smiles form, a sigh is heard: that’s
what we were looking for. The time has come to
pick up the pen left on the table to set down on a clean sheet of paper the traces of this mathemati- cal exchange which remain on the blackboard: the last chalk-written vestiges of a vibrant exchange which will be wiped out forever when the room is cleaned the next day.

## 走到黑板前！

谈论数学到一定程度，言语已不足以表达。这时你会拿出笔；在桌布上或地铁票上潦草写下的公式可以帮助理清问题，使对话再次开始。当讨论变得更为刺激，公式在小纸片上拥挤不堪时，你会站起来，拿出粉笔。曾在学生时代令人恐惧的黑板，现在却变得如此熟悉，它前来救场。在这里，你可以掌握数学；你涂涂改改、擦掉重写，形成一个摇摇欲坠的思想结构，只有一些痕迹留在黑板上。擦除器做它的工作，威胁着要抹去那些羞涩地在黑板上爬行的白色字符。每一次用力擦拭后，那些在之前清洗中幸存下来的字符又被一大片湿痕无情地覆盖。

静谧，平静；你放下擦除器，看看留下的公式。退后几步，衡量、评估，欣赏一个公式、一条命题、一项仍在进行中的证明……一种对黑板上仍留着的短暂涂鸦的优雅状态。任何稍有迟疑的评论或问题，可能会让幸存的句子、公式或符号永远消失。所以，你沉思……

最终，那些一直盯着黑板的眼睛互相对视，闪烁着满意和饱足的光芒；笑容浮现，一声叹息：这就是我们寻找的东西。此时，你会拿起留在桌上的笔，在一张干净的纸上记录下这次数学交流在黑板上留下的痕迹：最后用粉笔写下的鲜活交流的遗迹，第二天房间打扫时将永远被抹去。

## Lunch at IHES (1975–1995)


When I joined IHES in the fall of 1974, there were no duties—just the opportunity to think about mathematics. I needed more structure, so I chose the duty and fun of making sure the lunch was a useful source of scientific exchange.
So almost every day, I would arrive by lunchtime and participate in the discussion that continued through the meal, dessert, coffee and sometimes almost until teatime for a smaller har- dcore group.
During these discussions, which were mostly in English, we could learn from Deligne and exchange problems and ideas. My ploy was to take some idea or puzzle that was currently on my mind and convert it into an idea or question that held some general interest for those nearby at the table. Often the example would be placed in the arena of a young post doc or even more senior visitor.
Another ploy was to be vaguely aware of what most people were doing or were concerned with. Often I didn’t understand too much about the subject, just enough to notice if two people who hadn’t been “introduced” mathematically speaking were actually working on the same thing. In this way, Cheeger’s L2 theory was introduced to Goresky-MacPhersons intersection theory. Also Mostow rigidity theory was introduced to Bers’s quasi-Fuchsian deformation.
There were numerous other “introductions” at more modest scales every season.
Sometimes I was the main beneficiary of such discussions. On one of these occasions, I remember discussing with a topologist Ron Stern a concrete calculation of distribution of distor- tion of a Moebius transformation on the line (1/1+x2)dx. This explanation of a concrete exam- ple—required by him to understand my abstract statement—actually helped me by its concreteness and explicitness. This led to a proof that Kleinian groups didn’t have deformations on the limit set (1978).
It was also important to have long narrow
tables. This way, we could have quite technical conversations if need be with nearest neighbours without being impolite by exclusivity to further
away neighbours, who could have their own conversations.
At a round table such indiscretions are less pos-
sible because each person “sees more of the table”
in front of him. Such details are very important
for scientific dynamics.
Another detail was the flexible hotel system
and flexible arrangement in the kitchen. A few of
us could decide at the last minute whether or not
some visitor or someone not “prévu” could go to
lunch—assuming there was still food left.
I believe that the number of visitors now
means that this is no longer the case, and that
some of the senior professors who do not go to
lunch regularly cannot decide to do so at the last minute. I hope this is temporary, because lunch dynamics could be affected by losing some of the energy of the masters, which during my years at IHES was crucial—Pierre Deligne, Alain Connes, Misha Gromov....

## IHES的午餐时光（1975-1995）

1974年秋天，我加入了IHES，这里没有任何职责——只有思考数学的机会。我需要更多的结构，所以我选择了确保午餐成为有用的科学交流源泉的职责和乐趣。

几乎每天，我都会在午餐时间到达，参与贯穿整个用餐、甜点、咖啡，有时甚至持续到茶时间的小规模核心小组的讨论。

这些讨论大多用英语进行，我们可以从德利涅（Deligne）那里学习并交流问题和想法。我的策略是将我当前脑海中的一些想法或难题转化为在餐桌上引起普遍兴趣的问题。通常，这个例子会被放在年轻博士后甚至更资深访客的视野中。

另一种策略是模糊地了解大多数人的工作或关注点。通常我对这些主题了解不多，但足够注意到两个没有“数学上相识”的人实际上在研究同一问题。通过这种方式，Cheeger的L2理论被引入Goresky-MacPherson的交叉理论中。Mostow的刚性理论也被引入到Bers的准Fuchsian变形中。

每个季节都会有许多这种规模较小的“介绍”。

有时，我是这些讨论的主要受益者。在其中一次讨论中，我记得与拓扑学家Ron Stern讨论一项具体计算，关于在直线上Moebius变换的失真分布（1/1+x2）dx。这一具体示例的解释——他需要了解我的抽象陈述——通过它的具体性和明确性实际上帮助了我。这导致了一个证明，即Kleinian群在极限集上没有变形（1978年）。

长条桌也很重要。这样，我们可以在需要时与最近的邻居进行相当技术性的对话，而不会对远处的邻居显得无礼，他们可以进行自己的对话。

在圆桌上，这种不礼貌行为不太可能发生，因为每个人都“看到更多桌面”在他面前。这些细节对科学动态非常重要。

另一个细节是灵活的酒店系统和厨房安排。我们几个人可以在最后一刻决定是否让某个访客或未预料到的人去吃午餐——假设还有剩余食物。

我相信现在访客数量的增加意味着这种情况不再存在，一些不经常午餐的资深教授不能在最后一刻决定参加午餐。我希望这是暂时的，因为失去一些大师的能量会影响午餐动态，这在我在IHES的年代至关重要——Pierre Deligne、Alain Connes、Misha Gromov……

## Happy Day at Bures-sur-Yvette in the Sixties

I leave the Gare du Luxembourg around 9 o’clock in the morning in the direction of Saint-Rémy-les- Chevreuse. In the train, as I was expecting, I meet a friend ready to engage in conversation, on a ma- thematical subject, naturally (a strange train where the discussions between travellers, which are always impassioned, are not about the latest television pro- gramme but about objects with curious names). At the station of Bures-sur-Yvette, other travellers join us and the discussion continues, even livelier, as we cross a wood, rather like the enchanted forest of Brocéliande towards this marvellous institute, a modern version of Rabelais’s “Abbaye de Thélème”, dreamed up by the magician Léon Motchane, se- conded by the good fairy Annie Rolland.

On the way to my office, I stop for a moment to
greet our two presiding spirits, who are always wel-
coming, and here I am sitting at my desk between
a beautiful blackboard and an ample supply of
chalk, which, as everyone knows, are the indispen-
sable tools of a mathematician. My work progresses
but suddenly I have doubts about the validity of
certain arguments. Fortunately Deligne is not far away, and he soon dissipates my doubts (everyone here knows his generosity and takes advantage of it too often, perhaps).
Mathematics is very absorbing, but it makes you hungry and the lunch bell soon rings. With some difficulty I tear myself away from my precious papers and walk over to the cafeteria where thirty or so mathematicians, physicists, and members of staff are already sitting down, chatting animatedly about a variety of subjects. When the conversation turns to a hot topic in mathematics, often fascina- ting but difficult, I do my best to follow, sometimes successfully, sometimes not, and I am always filled with admiration and envy for “those who unders- tand everything”. The food is pleasant, the wine too, and mathematics (or physics, according to the day) lights up the whole scene.
After lunch most of us go to the seminar. For me this is a source of neverending enjoyment. If I am lucky enough to understand everything that the speaker says (let’s say Grothendieck, to give an idea) my happiness is complete. But even if it’s
not Grothendieck, I certainly wouldn’t miss these discussions, where we witness the birth of new concepts, whose power we can only guess, and
above all the exceptional moments when there is disagreement among the great experts: then the discussion is lively, voices rise higher and we can
see looming up the spectre of the fatal contradic-
tion, but everyone knows that the drama will not
take place and that we shall invariably witness the
miracle, which amazes all non-mathematicians
who have seen such impassioned jousts: the verbal
struggle ceases suddenly and one of the protago-
nists, with a burst of laughter, lays down his arms
and admits he was “being stupid”.

At four o’clock, tea is served and groups form infront of the blackboards to clarify a few last details.
Later, in the train going home, these “mathema- tical events” still fuel lively conversations; they mingle with the conversations of the students on their way home from the university, discussing the days’ classes. I am struck by their seriousness; here again I have a lot to learn.
At last here I am back in Paris and happy to see my wife, who has spent the day at the National Library (in the rue de Richelieu, where it was so pleasant to work). She too is pleased because she has found the books and documents she was loo- king for. We exchange our impressions of a full day. The prospect of a good dinner (my medieval scholar is also a “cordon bleu”) makes us see life in a rosy light.
Jacques Tits

## 六十年代在布尔-苏尔-伊夫特的幸福日子

早上九点左右，我从卢森堡车站出发，前往圣雷米-莱谢夫罗斯。在火车上，正如我所预料的那样，我遇到了一位朋友，自然地准备就一个数学话题展开讨论（这是一个奇怪的火车，旅客之间的讨论总是充满激情，讨论的话题不是最新的电视节目，而是一些名字奇怪的对象）。在布尔-苏尔-伊夫特站，其他旅客加入我们，讨论变得更加热烈，我们穿过一片树林，就像穿越布罗塞利昂德的魔法森林，朝着这个神奇的研究所走去，这是由魔法师莱昂·莫昌构想并在安妮·罗兰这位好仙女的协助下实现的现代版拉伯雷的“泰勒姆修道院”。

在前往办公室的路上，我停下来向两位始终热情欢迎我们的主宾致意，随后坐在我的书桌前，旁边是一个漂亮的黑板和大量的粉笔，众所周知，这是数学家的必备工具。我的工作进展顺利，但突然我对某些论据的有效性产生了怀疑。幸运的是，德利涅不远，他很快就打消了我的疑虑（这里的每个人都知道他的慷慨，并且可能过于频繁地利用这一点）。

数学非常吸引人，但它会让你感到饥饿，很快午餐铃声响起。我费了很大力气才从宝贵的论文中抽身，走向餐厅，那里已经有大约三十名数学家、物理学家和工作人员坐下来，热烈地讨论各种话题。当谈话转向一个热门的数学话题时，往往很吸引人但也很困难，我尽力跟上，有时成功，有时失败，但我总是对“那些理解一切的人”充满钦佩和嫉妒。食物美味，葡萄酒也不错，数学（或根据当天情况是物理学）点亮了整个场景。

午餐后，我们大多数人去参加研讨会。对我来说，这是一种永无止境的享受。如果我有幸理解演讲者所说的一切（比方说格罗滕迪克，那就可以想象了），我的幸福感会达到顶峰。但即使不是格罗滕迪克，我也不会错过这些讨论，在这些讨论中我们见证了新概念的诞生，其力量我们只能猜测，尤其是在专家们意见不一致的特殊时刻：讨论变得激烈，声音高涨，我们可以看到致命矛盾的幽灵若隐若现，但每个人都知道戏剧不会发生，我们将不可避免地见证奇迹，这令所有见过如此激烈争论的非数学家都感到惊讶：口头争斗突然停止，其中一位主角笑着放下武器，承认他“犯了傻”。

下午四点，茶点时间到了，人们在黑板前聚集，澄清最后的几个细节。稍后，在回家的火车上，这些“数学事件”仍然燃料般地激发着热烈的讨论；它们与那些从大学下课回家的学生的讨论交织在一起，学生们讨论当天的课程。他们的认真让我印象深刻；在这里，我又有很多东西要学。

终于，我回到了巴黎，见到我的妻子，她在国家图书馆度过了一天（在黎塞留街，在那里工作非常愉快）。她也很高兴，因为她找到了她正在寻找的书籍和文件。我们交流了一整天的感受。一个丰盛晚餐的前景（我的中世纪学者还是一位“烹饪高手”）让我们对生活充满了美好的期待。

## The Flowers of Maths

What is a mathematician?
Not a scientist
Not an artist
But caught between the two
In a world of structures and truths
Creating the seeds
But proving the flowers
And vaguely hoping
That their scent will save the world
Wendy Lowen

## 数学之花

什么是数学家？
不是科学家
不是艺术家
但夹在两者之间
在结构与真理的世界中
创造种子
但证明花朵
并模糊地希望
它们的芳香能拯救世界

## The Arcane in the Mundane

How delightful to discover our abstractions clo- thing Nature’s realities:
Singularities of smooth gradient maps in rain- bows and tsunamis
The Laplace operator in oriental magic mirrors
Elliptic integrals in the polarization pattern of the clear blue sky
Geometry of twists and turns in quantum indistinguishability
Matrix degeneracies in overhead-projector
transparencies
Gauss sums in the light beyond a humble dif-
fraction grating
More fundamentally, we are repeatedly asto-
nished to find, recently developed and quietly
waiting, exactly the mathematics we need for
physics: Riemannian geometry awaiting general
relativity, matrices awaiting quantum physics,
fibre bundles awaiting gauge theories of fun-
damental forces.... Should we be astonished? I think not. We are beings of finite intelligence in an infinite, inscrutable universe. In science, our individual intelligences cooperate, and we can understand more. But still, we are able to comprehend only those structures in the natural world that mirror our mental constructs. And at any stage of humanity’s development, the most sophisticated constructs are those of our mathe- matics. Therefore our deepest penetration into the natural world is limited by our latest mathematics. As mathematics develops, more subtle features of the universe become accessible to our understan- ding. While our species survives, I see no end to this process—no “Theory of everything”.
So, “the unreasonable effectiveness of mathe- matics in the natural sciences” is not unreasonable at all; on the contrary, it is inevitable. Not unreaso- nable, but wonderful!
Michael Berry

## 日常中的神秘

发现我们抽象的数学包裹着自然的现实是多么令人愉快：
彩虹和海啸中平滑梯度映射的奇点
东方魔镜中的拉普拉斯算子
晴朗蓝天中偏振图案中的椭圆积分
量子不可区分性中的扭曲几何
投影仪透明片中的矩阵简并
简陋衍射光栅后光线中的高斯和

更根本地，我们一次又一次地惊讶地发现，最近开发并静静等待的数学，正是我们需要的物理学：黎曼几何在等待广义相对论，矩阵在等待量子物理，纤维丛在等待基本力的规范理论……我们应该感到惊讶吗？我认为不应该。我们是有限智慧的生物，在一个无限、不可知的宇宙中。在科学中，我们的个体智慧合作，我们能理解更多。但即便如此，我们只能理解那些反映我们心智结构的自然界结构。在人类发展的任何阶段，最复杂的结构是我们的数学。因此，我们对自然界的最深刻理解受限于我们最新的数学。随着数学的发展，宇宙中更微妙的特征变得对我们的理解开放。只要我们物种生存下去，我认为这个过程不会结束——没有“万物理论”。

因此，“数学在自然科学中的非理性有效性”一点也不非理性；相反，这是必然的。不非理性，但令人惊叹！
——迈克尔·贝里

## Allegory

> “Space in itself, time in itself, are condemned to fade away like shadows, and only a kind of union of the two can preserve an independent reality.” 
> Hermann Minkowski, 1908

As usual after lunch when the weather is fine, X has discussed the partition of the day outside in the sun in the park, then has returned to the music room. As usual she opens her piano: soft pedal pressed down, she plays a few arpeggios to tame the silence, a few scales which rise and fall, crescendo, and finally a series of diminished chords which she allows to resonate, until they fade into silence. The music is there, ready to be discovered.
What will she work on this afternoon? Bach, Debussy that she had practiced the days before? Well, no: today she will come back to a piece which is more in her line! And she opens a parti-
tion, tattered from frequent use: Rachmaninoff’s third concerto—the feared, the inevitable “Rach
3”. Her whole life as a musician is hidden within
these pages. The long theme which opens the
work runs through her whole body and seems
to define time and space; she has known it since
adolescence; her first teacher presented it in class;

fascinated, she had asked him what it meant. “I don’t really know”, he had replied, humbly; and it seemed to her that she had been trying ever since to answer the question herself.... The cadenza of the first movement was her choice piece for audi- tions. With what determination she had spent hours rehearsing it! The scherzo of the second movement is covered with annotations, some of them written by the friend with whom she wor- ked at the time, who now devotes himself to Vinteuil’s sonata. They were both still beginners, and she remembers their impassioned arguments before they discovered that the clarinet’s melody was simply the main theme inverted. After that she had had a go at the central development, but was obliged to give up: her hands were too small. Recently she has tried again to master these formi- dable tenth chords and has succeeded in getting round the obstacles, playing a few notes in arpeg- gios, admittedly...but she thinks that now she can allow herself a little...clumsiness in her recital, let’s
say! As for the transposed accords of the finale, for her they are the most brilliant, most triumphant ones to be found in music. For years some tech- nical points eluded her and prevented her from fully expressing the spirit of them. Now she feels that she is close to the goal: but she concentrates a moment, quietens her thoughts and begins at the octave, one note with each hand, the first exposi- tion of the theme.
One by one, students, professors and their guests have entered the lecture hall to listen to
X, trying to convince them of the beauties of “Rach 3”. For an hour they listen to the melodies which seem to stretch out like a river; the chords
that resonate like a fanfare; the cadenzas seem to have been written for hands which are more than human. The audience appears to be caught up in these complex movements of the fingers which seem to fly across the keyboard, one over the other, twisting and untwisting; they feel the inner ten-
sion of the musician who has become anonymous, swept along by a maelstrom stronger than herself.
This tumultuous torrent of sound gradually enti-
ces them along, snatches them from the grip of
ordinary time—bearing them away astride a beam
of light!—and they reach the spheres of the uni-
versal beauty of harmony: once again the miracle
of music is accomplished. X plays the final chord.
The sounds dissolve and as silence falls, time...
absolute time...can start again. The audience
applauds but questions are immediately fired; and
for two more hours X explains the details of such
and such a point. When at last everyone has gone,
she will close the keyboard and, stepping outside,
will see that night has fallen on the park.

## 寓言

> “空间本身，时间本身，注定会像影子一样消逝，只有两者的某种结合才能保持独立的现实。” 
> 赫尔曼·闵可夫斯基，1908年

像往常一样，午饭后天气晴朗，X在公园的阳光下讨论了当天的安排，然后回到了音乐室。像往常一样，她打开钢琴：轻踏下弱音踏板，弹奏几个琶音以驯服寂静，几个音阶升降，渐强，最后是一系列减和弦，她让它们回响，直到它们消失在寂静中。音乐在那里，准备被发现。

她今天下午会练习什么呢？巴赫，德彪西，她前几天练习过的？好吧，不：今天她会回到更符合她风格的作品！她打开了一张因频繁使用而破旧的乐谱：拉赫玛尼诺夫的第三钢琴协奏曲——令人畏惧的、不可避免的“Rach 3”。她的整个音乐人生都隐藏在这些页面中。开篇的长主题贯穿她的全身，似乎定义了时间和空间；她从青少年时期就熟知它；她的第一位老师在课堂上展示了它；她着迷地问他这意味着什么。“我不太清楚”，他谦逊地回答；从那以后，她似乎一直在试图自己回答这个问题……第一乐章的华彩段是她选择的试演曲目。她带着多大的决心花费数小时排练它！第二乐章的小谐谑曲上覆盖着笔记，其中一些是与她合作的朋友写的，他现在专注于温托伊的奏鸣曲。他们都还是初学者，她记得他们在发现单簧管的旋律只是主旋律的倒影之前，曾经热烈地争论过。之后，她尝试了中央展开部分，但不得不放弃：她的手太小了。最近她再次尝试掌握这些可怕的十度和弦，并成功地绕过了障碍，尽管确实有些音符是琶音……但她认为现在她可以在演奏中允许自己一些……笨拙，让我们说！至于终乐章的转位和弦，对她来说，它们是音乐中最辉煌、最胜利的和弦。多年来，一些技术点让她困惑，无法完全表达它们的精神。现在她觉得自己接近目标了：但她集中一会儿，平静思绪，从八度开始，每只手一个音，第一次展现主题。

一个接一个，学生、教授和他们的客人进入讲堂，听X试图说服他们“Rach 3”的美丽。一小时内，他们聆听着旋律，似乎像河流一样延展；和弦像号角一样回响；华彩段似乎是为超过人类的双手而写的。观众似乎被这些复杂的手指运动所吸引，这些手指似乎在键盘上飞舞，交错缠绕；他们感受到音乐家的内在紧张，她已变得匿名，被一个比她更强大的漩涡席卷。这喧嚣的声音洪流逐渐引诱他们，带他们脱离普通时间——在一道光束上骑行！——他们达到了和谐的普遍美：音乐的奇迹再次实现。X弹奏了最后一个和弦。声音消散，随着寂静降临，时间……绝对的时间……可以重新开始。观众鼓掌，但问题立即出现；接下来的两个小时里，X解释了某个点的细节。当最后所有人都离开时，她合上键盘，走到外面，看到公园里已经夜幕降临。

## Correspondence

We solicited the collaboration of Professor Wakimoto during his stay at the IHES, and a little later we received this text by email.
While I was staying at the IHES in the early spring of 2006, many plants were still sleeping and it was too early for them to bloom. But the days at the IHES were very fruitful through sti- mulating discussions on quantum reduction and collaboration with Professor Kac. At the IHES, we found a good class of nilpotent elements, and named them “exceptional’’ nilpotent elements, and started the study of the representation theory of W-algebras associated to these nilpotent elements.
Also there is a nice bakery near l’Ormaille, (the residence where I was living) and I often bought my favourite baguettes there on the way back from the IHES.
Eager to know more, we thanked him for his reply,
and asked him another question: “What is quantic
reduction?” He replied that he was a little busy just
then, but we could continue our conversation in the
following weeks. When it arrived, his detailed ex- planation fully satisfied us.
There are two very important classes of infinite- dimensional Lie algebras and Lie superalgebras, “affine Lie algebras” and “superconformal algebras”. These infinite-dimensional algebras are not only interesting in themselves, but are also important because of their applications in various areas of mathematics and mathematical physics. We are interested in the structure and representation theory of these algebras.
There exist remarkable differences between affine Lie algebras and superconformal algebras. For affine Lie algebras, there are important devices such as “non-degenerate invariant bilinear form” and “Weyl group”, which play a very important role in their representation theory. For superconformal algebras, however, there are no such basically important tools, so the representation theory of superconformal algebras has been quite difficult.
In 1980s, the theory of “W-algebras” was developed by physicists, and also representations of some superconformal algebras were studied
by physicists. In 1990, B. Feigin and E. Frenkel found a homological method to construct W-algebras associated to affine Lie algebras, by using the chain complex obtained from tensoring
the universal enveloping algebra and the space
of charged fermions. This method is called the “quantization of the Drinfeld-Sokolov reduction” or simply “quantum reduction”.
A few years ago, we extended Feigin-Frenkel’s
theory to any Lie superalgebra G and any nilpotent
element f and gave a method to construct the
W-algebra W (G,f) of level K. In our viewpoint,Feigin-Frenkel’s theory is the W-algebra associated to the principal nilpotent element. All of so far known important superconformal algebras are obtained by our theory. The theory of W-algebra via quantum reduction has an advantage that representations of an affine Lie superalgebra W (G,f) of level K naturally give rise to representations of the W-algebra W (G,f) and we are now studying representation theory of superconformal algebras in this way.
This reply whet our appetite, and we asked Professor Wakimoto what a researcher in mathematics or phy- sics got out of a stay in a foreign institute, since as long as he has a blackboard, a piece of chalk and a computer, a mathematician is at home everywhere.
In an institute, we can discuss directly and exchange ideas freely on the subjects which inte- rest us. This would be the most important benefit. Another important reason is, I think, the “atmos- phere” as you have just pointed out. While we are staying at an institute, we can share a place with excellent mathematicians from various kinds of fields. And then it sometimes happens that we get inspired, which leads to a new viewpoint, even in the case when our research areas do not seem to be so close. 

Realizing that Professor Wakimoto thought he had said enough about his craft, we finally questioned him about the “baguette” from the local bakery. What was the best part? The crispy crust? The soft inside? The smell of fresh bread? The way it crackles? Did he, like many French people, snap off the end to munch before he got home? He replied:Yes, all of that! Its crust is very crispy, and
inside it’s soft with a slight salty fragrance! And
my wife and I loved nibbling the bread hot from
the oven on our way home.
Thank you very much for your interesting questions.
Minoru Wakimoto

## 通信

我们在鹤见教授访问高等科学研究所（IHES）期间邀请他进行合作，不久之后我们通过电子邮件收到了这篇文章。
在2006年初春我在IHES逗留期间，许多植物仍在沉睡，尚未开放。但在IHES的日子非常充实，通过关于量子约化的激动人心的讨论以及与Kac教授的合作。在IHES，我们发现了一类好的幂零元素，并将它们命名为“特殊”幂零元素，并开始研究与这些幂零元素相关的W代数的表示理论。
此外，在我居住的奥尔迈尔（l'Ormaille）附近有一家很棒的面包店，我经常在从IHES回来的路上在那里买我喜欢的法棍面包。

我们迫切想了解更多，感谢他的回复，并向他提出了另一个问题：“什么是量子约化？”他回复说他当时有点忙，但我们可以在接下来的几周内继续我们的对话。当他的详细解释到来时，我们完全满意了。
有两类非常重要的无限维李代数和李超代数，“仿射李代数”和“超共形代数”。这些无限维代数不仅本身很有趣，而且因其在数学和数学物理的各个领域中的应用而变得重要。我们对这些代数的结构和表示理论感兴趣。
仿射李代数和超共形代数之间存在显著差异。对于仿射李代数，有一些重要的工具，如“非退化不变双线性形式”和“魏尔群”，它们在表示理论中起着非常重要的作用。然而，对于超共形代数，没有这样的基本重要工具，因此超共形代数的表示理论一直相当困难。
在20世纪80年代，物理学家发展了“W代数”的理论，还研究了一些超共形代数的表示。1990年，B. Feigin和E. Frenkel通过使用从张量化普遍包络代数和带电费米子的空间获得的链复形，找到了一种同调方法来构建与仿射李代数相关的W代数。这种方法被称为“Drinfeld-Sokolov约化的量子化”或简单的“量子约化”。
几年前，我们将Feigin-Frenkel的理论扩展到任意李超代数G和任意幂零元素f，并给出了一种构建水平K的W代数W(G,f)的方法。在我们的观点中，Feigin-Frenkel的理论是与主要幂零元素相关的W代数。所有已知的重要超共形代数都是通过我们的理论获得的。通过量子约化的W代数理论的一个优点是，仿射李超代数W(G,f)的水平K的表示自然会产生W代数W(G,f)的表示，我们现在正以这种方式研究超共形代数的表示理论。
这个回答激发了我们的兴趣，我们问鹤见教授，一个数学或物理研究人员在外国研究所停留期间能得到什么，因为只要有一块黑板、一支粉笔和一台电脑，数学家在任何地方都能如鱼得水。
在研究所里，我们可以直接讨论和自由交换我们感兴趣的课题的想法。这是最重要的好处。我认为另一个重要原因是“氛围”，正如你们刚才提到的。在研究所逗留期间，我们可以与来自各个领域的优秀数学家分享一个地方。有时，即使我们的研究领域看似不那么接近，也会因为受到启发而获得新的视角。
意识到鹤见教授觉得他已经说了足够多的专业内容，我们最后问了他关于当地面包店的“法棍”问题。最好的部分是什么？是酥脆的外壳？柔软的内心？新鲜面包的香味？还是它破裂的声音？他像许多法国人一样，会在回家前掰断末端吃吗？他回答说：是的，所有这些！它的外壳非常酥脆，里面柔软，有轻微的咸香味！我和妻子都喜欢在回家的路上啃热腾腾的面包。非常感谢你们有趣的问题。
——鹤见实



## Ilan

I have visited the IHES many times over the last 30 years and, with the exception of Grothendieck, have met all its members. However, I shall write neither about the inspiring discussions and colla- borations, nor about the discoveries made in this great institution.
An old joke claims that God will never be able to get tenure at an academic institution since he had only one publication. Fortunately, God does have tenure, but even demigods need it, and here comes the IHES to provide for that. The present collection will undoubtedly focus much of its attention on these great men (a demigoddess is yet to come), and rightly so. But I shall not write about this, the most glorious side of the IHES.
Another great source of strength of the IHES is that it is meant not only for demigods. It provides a safe haven for a great variety of men and women, who for the most part have regular jobs elsewhere (with often a less ideal environment for work), but sometimes with no other place to go.

Ilan was one of these few men. He was very different from the rest of us. Always well dressed and funny, somewhat of a playboy, he was inte- rested in a lot of things. One week he would give a talk on p-adic analysis, a few weeks later on the Archimedes method of counting the grains of sand, and yet another talk on an esoteric problem in number theory.
Once, in the IHES tea room, I called Ilan’s attention to an article of a Moscow high school teacher on the problems used to eliminate candidates of Jewish origin at the entrance exami- nations to the Math Department of Moscow State University. Some time later I received his treatise with a thorough analysis of the problems and the time needed for their solution.
“I leave aside the moral side of the question,” he writes, “my goal is to analyze the complexity of the problems involved.” It took him two to three hours to find a solution for each problem, while for these same problems unwanted candidates had been given only a few minutes. Needless to say, all problems designed for the rest of the candidates had been solved by Ilan in a matter of seconds.
The urgency of the question “Should the per- petrators of the crime be invited to the IHES?” is fading away, as these people are nearing their retirement age. Also fading away is the postcard sent to me by Ilan with the photograph of the cafe on Place Contrescarpe, where he was writing his treatise.

## 伊兰

在过去30年里，我多次访问IHES，除了格罗滕迪克，我见过所有的成员。然而，我不会写关于那些鼓舞人心的讨论和合作，也不会写在这个伟大机构中取得的发现。
一个老笑话说，上帝永远无法在学术机构获得终身教职，因为他只有一篇发表的文章。幸运的是，上帝确实拥有终身教职，但即使是半神也需要它，而IHES正是为此提供的。当前的这本文集无疑会集中大量关注这些伟人（至今还没有半女神出现），这是完全正确的。但我不会写关于IHES的这个最辉煌的一面。
IHES的另一个巨大力量来源在于它不仅仅是为半神们准备的。它为各种各样的人提供了一个安全的避风港，这些人中的大多数在其他地方有正常的工作（通常工作环境不那么理想），但有时却无处可去。

伊兰就是这些少数人之一。他和我们其他人非常不同。总是穿着得体，风趣幽默，有点像花花公子，对很多事情感兴趣。有一周他会做一个关于p进分析的讲座，几周后关于阿基米德计算沙粒数量的方法的讲座，还有一个关于数论中晦涩问题的讲座。
有一次，在IHES的茶室里，我让伊兰注意到一篇由莫斯科高中老师撰写的关于在莫斯科国立大学数学系入学考试中用来淘汰犹太候选人的问题的文章。后来我收到了他的论文，详细分析了这些问题及其解决所需的时间。
“我撇开道德问题不谈”，他写道，“我的目标是分析所涉及问题的复杂性。”他花了两到三个小时才找到每个问题的解决方案，而对于这些问题，不受欢迎的候选人只被给了几分钟时间。不用说，设计给其他候选人的所有问题伊兰在几秒钟内就解决了。
“犯罪的肇事者是否应该被邀请到IHES？”这个问题的紧迫性正在消退，因为这些人正接近退休年龄。还有伊兰寄给我的明信片也在慢慢消退，明信片上有他在写论文时所在的Contrescarpe广场咖啡馆的照片。

## The Four Mysteries of the World

The first mystery in the world is that of the na- ture of physical laws. One believes the structure radiates from a single point, something uniquely distinguished by the highest imaginable degree of symmetry, the symmetry that gets diluted and dis- sipates as the universe unravels itself to a human observer.
The second mystery is that of life. The dissi- pated structural symmetry of physical matter evolves into another kind of structure, condenses to structural islands in the exponentially large sea of all imaginable outcomes.
The third mystery is the function of the brain.
Here an accidentally developed, seemingly amor-
phous mass of organic matter is able, by following physically dictated pathways, to select a proper response from the double exponential space of (imaginary?) possibilities.
The only way to represent any of the three
structures in a format comprehensible to the
human mind (brain?) is to construct mathema-
tical models.

Almost all we see in mathematics today has evolved under the influence of the first of the three mysteries. Mathematicians keep searching for the ultimate symmetry of the universe projec- ted onto the human reasoning. But nothing like that has ever helped in elucidating the structures of life and of the mind (brain).
And here the fourth mystery comes in, the mystery of mathematical structure. Why and when does it appear, how can we model it, and how does the brain manage to create it out of the chaos of the external input?
Maybe we shall have a glimpse of the answer at the 500th anniversary of the IHES.
Mikhail Gromov

## 世界的四大谜团

世界上的第一个谜团是物理规律的本质。人们相信，结构从一个点辐射出来，这个点具有最高的想象中的对称性，但当宇宙向人类观察者展现自己时，这种对称性会被稀释和消散。
第二个谜团是生命。在物质结构稀释的对称性中，演化出另一种结构，在所有可想象的结果的指数级大的海洋中凝结成结构岛屿。
第三个谜团是大脑的功能。在这里，一块偶然发育的、看似无定形的有机物质，通过遵循物理决定的路径，能够从（想象的？）可能性的双重指数空间中选择出正确的反应。
以一种能为人类心灵（大脑？）理解的格式表示上述任何一种结构的唯一方法就是构建数学模型。

今天我们在数学中看到的几乎所有东西都是在第一个谜团的影响下演变而来的。数学家们不断寻找投射到人类推理上的宇宙的最终对称性。但没有任何类似的东西帮助我们阐明生命和心灵（大脑）的结构。
而这里出现了第四个谜团，数学结构的谜团。为什么以及何时会出现数学结构，我们如何建模，以及大脑如何从外部输入的混沌中创造出数学结构？
也许我们会在IHES成立500周年时窥见答案。

## State of Grace

In 1975–76 I came to Paris for my first exten-
ded stay abroad, a year at the IHES. The whole experience was extraordinary! We came by boat—
that really dates it—my wife Monika napping
on the deck, expecting our first child. It was my
first experience trying to make friends and live in
a language other than English. I learned about a
field distant from my previous work—singula- rities—and proved some theorems of which I’m
still proud.
But these were not the only major effects of my
visit. It was perhaps the opportunity to be close
to some of the world’s greatest and most interes-
ting mathematicians, spending time there, in a
relaxed environment that was most important.
Mumford was there, and many others, active and
accessible. I got to know Nico Kuiper, Bernard
Teissier, Norbert O’Campo, Lê Dung Trang. But
the special atmosphere at the Institute, the lunches
together, the common experiences, were of fun-
damental importance to me. Strolling around the
grounds thirty years later took me back to...
Pierre Deligne, just a few years my senior but
long since a legend, was at that time a “permanent”
member. I had done a little work that I thought might be interesting to him, and of course I explai- ned it—or tried to. He saw at once that there was a little problem, a finiteness assumption that was not justified. The proof survived this revision, but the rapidity of his understanding and his ability to explain—anything, seemingly—at the perfect level for whoever was listening in one-to-one conversation impressed me deeply.
Deligne’s tutelage was not confined to mathe- matics. He took me bicycling on trails in the hills across the valley, my first experience with moun- tain biking, before I even knew the name. He also taught me a lesson about mathematical society: I addressed him politely as “vous”, but he explained that all mathematicians in France “se tutoient”— use the familiar form of “you” to each other—not because they were all laid-back, groovy people, but because they were “in principle»” all former students of the École Normale, the school that has produced so many great French mathematicians since its founding by Napoleon.
René Thom’s famous seminar was still in action, and I learned an important lesson at its first ses-sion that year. Thom introduced the subject for the seminar, saying we would study consequences of such and such a theorem, proved in the seminar the year before. A brave soul in the audience raised his hand and proposed a counterexample. There was discussion, and after a while there was general agreement that the counterexample was correct. “Now,” said Thom, in no way perturbed, “let us continue with the consequences of the Theorem.” It was the big picture that counted.
During the year that I was there, Quillen and Suslin proved “Serre’s Conjecture” (he insisted, correctly, that he”d only stated a “problem”, but the name was universally used.) It was a problem that was discussed a lot by Swan, Kaplansky and their students around Chicago; I was asked to pre- sent the proof at the IHES—with Serre, among others, in the audience. I’m not sure I’ve ever been as nervous about a talk! During it, Serre raised his
hand and pointed out a little flaw in the argument as I was giving it. I managed to repair it on the spot, but my friends in the audience told me afte- rwards that I seemed as worried as if it had been my own proof.
Twenty years after my year at the IHES, I became Director of the Mathematical Sciences Research Institute in Berkeley (MSRI), so I’ve had a lot of time and reason to think about the experiences that Institutes provide, and a lot of visiting young people to watch. I know now that my experience at the IHES was not so unusual in its impact. Time to think, the presence of great mathematicians, an atmosphere of mutual respect and contact—these are things Institutes provide, things that influence young people (and others too) very deeply. I am grateful to the IHES for these gifts.
David Eisenbud

## 恩宠状态

1975-76年，我来到巴黎进行了第一次长时间的国外逗留，在IHES度过了一年。这段经历非同寻常！我们坐船来的——这真是一个年代的象征——我的妻子莫妮卡在甲板上小憩，期待着我们的第一个孩子。这是我第一次尝试在英语以外的语言环境中交朋友和生活。我学到了一个与我之前工作相距甚远的领域——奇点——并证明了一些至今我仍感到自豪的定理。
但这些并不是我访问的唯一重大影响。也许最重要的是，有机会接近世界上一些最伟大和最有趣的数学家，在那里，在一种轻松的环境中度过时光。
曼福德在那里，还有许多其他人，活跃且易接近。我认识了尼科·奎普尔、伯纳德·特西耶、诺伯特·奥坎波、Lê Dung Trang。但研究所的特殊氛围，共同的午餐，共同的经历，对我来说是根本重要的。三十年后，在研究所的场地上漫步，使我回到了……
皮埃尔·德利涅，比我年长几岁但早已是传奇人物，当时是一个“永久”成员。我做了一些我认为他可能感兴趣的工作，当然我向他解释了——或者尝试解释。他立刻看出了一个小问题，一个没有得到证明的有限性假设。这个证明在修订后依然成立，但他理解的快速性和他解释任何事情的能力——似乎——在一对一的对话中，总是能恰到好处地契合听者的水平，这给我留下了深刻的印象。
德利涅的教导不仅限于数学。他带我在山谷对面的山上骑自行车，这是我第一次体验山地骑行，当时我甚至不知道这个名字。他还教了我一课关于数学界的礼仪：我礼貌地称呼他为“您”，但他解释说，所有法国数学家之间都用“你”来称呼彼此——不是因为他们都是放松、随和的人，而是因为“原则上”他们都是高等师范学院的前学生，这所学校自拿破仑创办以来培养了许多伟大的法国数学家。
勒内·托姆著名的研讨会仍在进行，我在那一年第一次会议上学到了一个重要的教训。托姆介绍了研讨会的主题，说我们将研究某个定理的后果，这个定理是在前一年的研讨会上证明的。观众中一个勇敢的灵魂举手提出了一个反例。经过讨论，大家一致认为反例是正确的。“现在，”托姆说，毫不惊慌，“让我们继续研究这个定理的后果。”重要的是大局。
在我在那里的那一年，奎伦和苏斯林证明了“塞尔猜想”（他坚持正确地称其为“问题”，但这个名字被普遍使用）。这是一个被斯万、卡普兰斯基及其学生在芝加哥讨论了很多的问题；我被要求在IHES上介绍这个证明——包括塞尔在内的观众。我不确定我是否曾对一个演讲如此紧张！在演讲

中，塞尔举手指出了我在讲述中一个小缺陷。我当场设法修复了它，但我的朋友们事后告诉我，我看起来就像这是我自己的证明一样担忧。
在IHES的一年后，我成为了伯克利数学科学研究所（MSRI）的主任，所以我有很多时间和理由思考研究所提供的体验，并观察许多访问的年轻人。我现在知道，我在IHES的经历在其影响上并不那么特殊。思考的时间、伟大数学家的存在、相互尊重和接触的氛围——这些都是研究所提供的东西，深深影响着年轻人（以及其他人）。我对IHES为我提供的这些礼物心存感激。

## Violins

Mathematicians are like violin makers. They inhe- rit a craftsmanship accumulated through centuries and their apparent modesty cannot hide the pride which this knowledge inspires in them. Part of the heritage has been lost: Fermat’s proof looks like the secret of Cremona varnish.

From time to time, the virtuosos of science
come and consult mathematicians to ask for help tuning their theories so that they ring true and harmonious.
Christophe Soulé


## 小提琴

数学家就像小提琴制造者。他们继承了数个世纪积累的手艺，他们表面上的谦逊无法掩盖这种知识带给他们的自豪感。部分遗产已经丢失：费马的证明就像克雷莫纳清漆的秘密。

科学的演奏家们不时会来咨询数学家，寻求帮助以调整他们的理论，使其发出真实而和谐的声音。

——克里斯托夫·苏莱


## Mathematics as Culture and Knowledge

Mathematics is an intellectual activity, arguably one of the most sophisticated ever produced by human civilization. Hermann Hesse sketched a portrait of the activities of mathematicians through the metaphor of the Glass Bead Game. That was perhaps the best literary attempt at cat- ching a glimpse of some inner workings of the society of mathematicians. One does not blame a fictional work for inaccuracy, but it is indeed a difficult task to say something meaningful about what it is like to do mathematics.

There are quite a few mathematicians who
entertain a Platonist view of mathematics. By this
I mean essentially the belief that mathematical
objects and constructs enjoy some kind of exis-
tence in a “world of ideas”, independent of the
human mind. As in the case of the mythical hea-
ven, the proposers of such beliefs tend to be quite
vague on the location and consistency of this extra-
mental Platonic world. One reason that is often
produced in support of the Platonic standpoint
is the effectiveness of mathematics in modelling
the physical world. No doubt that Kepler’s laws
would eventually be observed and understood by
any technological intelligence living on a planet bound by gravity to revolve around a star (but would such a discovery follow the course we know, had the planet been revolving around two stars?). However, one can hardly make an equally strong case in support of other very beautiful but far more abstract branches of mathematics.

If no one would perhaps doubt that any suffi- ciently evolved extraterrestrial intelligence would understand the notion of prime number, there is far less compelling evidence that they would have our same notions of derived categories or shtukas. Recent years have gotten us used to more and more sophisticated mathematics being recruited to account for increasingly complicated models of high-energy physics. This sort of evidence notwithstanding, I personally remain extremely sceptical about the Platonist hypothesis.

Our brains developed over millions of years of evolution by natural selection. The capacity to produce mathematics has an obvious evolu- tionary advantage in as much as it is the key to the development of a scientific and technological civilization. The prominent position that this spe-cies of apes has acquired, compared to the other
animal species of the planet, is a clear demonstra-
tion of the evolutionary advantage of the brain’s
capacity for scientific thought.

Other brains that are the product of a comple-
tely different evolutionary process in an entirely
different environment might also achieve the same
goal of a technological civilization while produ-
cing a substantially different kind of mathematics
from the one we know. Not entirely disjoint,
surely (prime numbers), but with possibly a vast symmetric difference. The existence of extrater- restrial intelligence is purely hypothetical. Sagan and Shklovskii speculated beautifully about it in the seventies and I will leave it at that, Platonism and all.

If mathematics (a large part of mathematics at least) is not a glimpse of the Platonic paradise but merely a by-product of our brains and evolutio- nary processes, it loses none of its beauty because of that. It is all the more interesting because it is a part of human culture, and it moves along with and is influenced by the development of the rest of our civilization.
The mathematics that we know today is the
result of a long and tortuous itinerary of cultural development. It is far from being a static edifice,
however. Its continuous, rapid evolution can be
seen easily by mentioning a couple of significant
statistics. MathSciNet, the main source of reviews
of mathematical publications, lists a total of 2,245,194 items, growing at the speed of 60,000 per year (and those listed by MathSciNet are just a selection of the total number of mathematical publications).

The first important step for anyone interested in working in mathematics is an awareness of the vastness of the landscape. One of the major risks, in my opinion, in mathematics and in many other fields of human knowledge, is that of being naive.

One does not improvise oneself a mathematician. Becoming one takes about ten years of intensive training and careful study. That’s just in order to accumulate the minimal amount of knowledge and skills that are needed to understand what doing mathematics is about. To start to actually do something still requires a few further steps.

One, which is extremely difficult to acquire, and is a good sign of having achieved maturity as a professional mathematician, is the capacity to sniff out what is interesting. There are many things in mathematics one can do for the sake of doing them. Marcel Duchamp entitled one of his provocative sculptures “Classify the combs by the number of their teeth”.

Truly interesting mathematics is not a technical exercise in classifying combs. Often what makes
a mathematical result surprising and interesting
lies in discovering unexpected connections: a way
of relating results and constructions that were seemingly unrelated, recognizing a similarity of structures across apparently different phenomena.
This requires knowledge. One has to be able to
comfortably navigate the existent in order to be
able to envision the nonexistent.
Being naive in mathematics has (with rare
exceptions) the sole effect of digging oneself
into an obscure corner of useless game-playing.
Knowledge is what provides the crucial lighthou-
ses and nautical charts that allow working
mathematicians to navigate their way safely across
rough waters.

There are widespread romantic mythologies
about lonely geniuses who don’t read but still
generate beautiful theorems. These are based on
largely fabricated anecdotal accounts. In truth, a
long time spent reading and acquiring knowledge of present and past mathematics is essential to creating interesting future mathematics. Isolation only means the drying up of creative abilities.

Besides its effectiveness as a catalyst of inven- tion, the transmission of knowledge through the written word is what makes us human. It is the key to the advancement of civilization. We read and learn because it is a great pleasure to do so, because we are human beings who care about being not an isolated fragment but a part of huma- nity as a whole. As in John Donne’s famous poem, “No man is an island, entire of itself; every man is a piece of the continent, a part of the main.”

Mathematics is interesting to an especially high degree among the achievements of humanity, because it has a universality that can provide us with a way to bridge and transcend the insignifi- cant geographic and historic differences that split humankind. It is the common language our brains are hardwired to produce, the one that drives our scientific and technological development and is at the same time a deeply philosophical and artistic kind of endeavour.

Indeed, this is a peculiar aspect of mathema- tics that singles it out among the various fields of human knowledge. It functions simultaneously with the modes of the hard sciences and with those of the fine arts. Flights of the imagination, visual and poetic imageries and esthetical consi- derations drive the development of the field and live side by side with the most stringent rules of scientific rigor.

It is a pity that neuroscientists trying to understand how the brain develops mathematics generally tend to confuse mathematics with “num-ber sense”. The latter is a completely different faculty of the intellect, which is often completely disjoint from mathematics itself (there are plenty of examples of famous mathematicians who have no number sense at all). Mathematics is about the creation of structures and, in particular, numbers also exhibit interesting structures, but that’s as far as the connection goes.

Understanding how mathematics is created in our brains will be a wonderful way to discover more of the functioning of the brain itself, since it provides a full spectrum of modes of operation of creativity and imagination as well as of manipu- lation of images and symbols, with a very precise and well-defined focus.

The final answer, if one is needed, to the ques- tion of why we do mathematics, is that we derive pleasure from doing so. It is an obvious by-product of evolution by natural selection that we derive pleasure from doing things that are also beneficial to the survival of our genes. Mathematics is bene- ficial to our species because of the applications it has to our science and technology, but that’s not the reason why we enjoy doing mathematics. We do not think of the importance of practical appli- cations when we enjoy creating new mathematics any more than we think of the importance of mixing our DNAs when we enjoy having sex.

## 作为文化和知识的数学

数学是一种智力活动，可以说是人类文明所产生的最复杂的活动之一。赫尔曼·黑塞通过玻璃珠游戏的隐喻描绘了数学家的活动。这也许是对数学家社会内部运作的一次最好的文学尝试。没人会因为一部虚构作品的准确性而责怪它，但要说清楚做数学是什么样的确实是件困难的事情。

有相当多的数学家持有柏拉图主义的数学观。这基本上意味着他们相信数学对象和构造在某种“理念世界”中享有某种存在，独立于人类思维。正如神话中的天堂一样，这种信仰的提出者往往对这个超越思维的柏拉图世界的位置和一致性相当模糊。支持柏拉图立场的一个常见理由是数学在建模物理世界中的有效性。毫无疑问，开普勒定律最终会被任何生活在绕恒星旋转的行星上的科技智能所观察和理解（但如果行星围绕两颗恒星旋转，这一发现会按照我们所知的路径发生吗？）。然而，很难同样有力地支持其他非常美丽但更为抽象的数学分支。

或许没有人会怀疑任何足够进化的外星智能都会理解素数的概念，但很少有令人信服的证据表明他们会有我们对派生范畴或Shtukas的相同概念。近年来，我们越来越习惯于越来越复杂的数学被用于解释高能物理的日益复杂的模型。尽管有这种证据，我个人对柏拉图主义假说仍然非常怀疑。

我们的脑子在数百万年的自然选择进化中发育而成。生产数学的能力显然具有进化优势，因为它是科学和技术文明发展的关键。这种类人猿相对于地球上其他动物物种所获得的显著地位清楚地表明了大脑科学思维能力的进化优势。

在完全不同环境中经过完全不同进化过程产生的其他大脑可能也会达到技术文明的同一目标，同时产生一种与我们所知的数学大不相同的数学。尽管不完全不相交（例如素数），但可能存在巨大的对称差异。外星智能的存在纯属假设。萨根和什克洛夫斯基在七十年代对此进行了美丽的猜测，我就此打住，柏拉图主义及所有。
如果数学（至少大部分数学）不是柏拉图天堂的一个瞥见，而仅仅是我们大脑和进化过程的副产品，它也不会因此失去任何美感。它更有趣，因为它是人类文化的一部分，并随着我们文明的发展而发展。

我们今天所知道的数学是一个漫长而曲折的文化发展历程的结果。它远非一个静态的建筑。然而，它的持续、快速演变可以通过提到几个重要的统计数据轻松看出。MathSciNet，数学出版物评论的主要来源，列出了总共2,245,194篇文献，每年以60,000篇的速度增长（MathSciNet列出的只是数学出版物总数的一个选择）。
任何对从事数学工作感兴趣的人的第一个重要步骤是意识到其广阔的领域。在我看来，数学和许多其他人类知识领域的主要风险之一是天真。

没有人能即兴成为数学家。成为一个数学家需要大约十年的密集训练和仔细学习。这只是为了积累理解做数学所需的最少量的知识和技能。实际上要开始做一些事情仍然需要一些进一步的步骤。

其中一个非常难以获得，并且是作为专业数学家成熟的一个好标志，就是辨别什么是有趣的能力。在数学中，有很多事情可以为了做而做。马塞尔·杜尚将他的一件挑衅性雕塑命名为“按齿数分类梳子”。

真正有趣的数学不是分类梳子的技术练习。通常，数学结果令人惊讶和有趣之处在于发现意想不到的联系：将看似无关的结果和构造联系起来，认识到不同现象中的结构相似性。

这需要知识。必须能够自在地导航现有的知识，以便能够设想不存在的东西。
在数学中天真（除少数例外）唯一的效果是将自己陷入无用游戏的黑暗角落。知识是为现役数学家提供导航工具和海图，使他们能够安全穿越波涛汹涌的水域的关键。
关于孤独天才不阅读但仍能产生美丽定理的浪漫神话广泛流传。这些神话大多基于捏造的轶事。实际上，长时间阅读和学习当前和过去的数学对于创造未来有趣的数学是必不可少的。孤立只意味着创造能力的枯竭。

除了作为发明催化剂的有效性，通过书面文字传递知识也是使我们成为人类的关键。它是文明进步的关键。我们阅读和学习，因为这是一个巨大的乐趣，因为我们是关心不成为孤立片段而成为整个人类一部分的人类。正如约翰·多恩著名的诗所说，“没有人是一座孤岛，独立存在；每个人都是大陆的一部分，整体的一部分。”

在所有人类成就中，数学尤其有趣，因为它具有一种普遍性，可以为我们提供一种方式来弥合和超越分裂人类的不重要的地理和历史差异。它是我们大脑被硬连接以生产的共同语言，驱动我们的科学和技术发展，同时也是一种深刻的哲学和艺术追求。
的确，这正是数学在各种人类知识领域中独树一帜的一个独特方面。它同时以硬科学的模式和美术的模式运作。想象力的飞跃、视觉和诗意的意象以及美学的考虑推动了这一领域的发展，并与最严格的科学严谨规则并存。

神经科学家试图理解大脑如何发展数学时通常会混淆数学和“数字感”，这是一个遗憾。后者是智力的一种完全不同的能力，通常与数学本身完全无关（有很多著名数学家完全没有数字感的例子）。数学是关于结构的创造，特别是数字也展示了有趣的结构，但这只是联系的范围。

理解数学在我们大脑中的创造过程将是一种美妙的方式来发现更多大脑的功能，因为它提供了从创造力和想象力的操作模式到图像和符号的操作模式的全谱，并具有非常精确和明确的焦点。

如果需要一个最终答案来解释我们为什么做数学，那就是我们从中获得乐趣。这是自然选择进化的一个明显副产品，我们从做对我们基因生存有益的事情中获得乐趣。数学对我们这个物种有益，因为它在我们的科学和技术中的应用，但这不是我们享受做数学的原因。当我们享受创造新数学时，我们并不会想到实际应用的重要性，就像我们在享受性爱时不会想到混合我们的DNA的重要性一样。

## A Question of Time 

The interface between mathematics and molecular biology, which for some years I tried to investigate,
being at the institute, represented for me a novel
and different intellectual activity. Mathematics, as
I was doing it at that time, is based on no data, contrary to math-biology which requires ma- thematical thinking, where progress, methods
and intuition depend strongly on the analysis of datasets. Theorems are replaced by a numerical verification of hypotheses over known datasets,
and in fact, any progress in the understanding
of evolution and coevolution does not seem wi-
thin the reach of purely theoretical thinking. In
some cases, probabilistic contributions have been
demonstrated to be fundamental, as has been the
case for the Lander-Waterman analysis for ge-
nome sequencing. The problem of establishing
conditions ensuring a parallel reconstruction of
genome sequences of multiple organisms is still
open, and probabilistic modeling is asked to cla-
rify such fundamental questions, which will lead
to a different understanding of the biology of mi-
crobes and their environment. Genomics moves
today towards integrating “environment” in its definition, and on this line of thinking, homo sapiens is understood through his interaction with millions of different microbes determining his environment. Understanding unicellular and multicellular organisms together with their en- vironment constitutes the leap we are expecting from biology in the near future, and a mathe- matical formalization of appropriate spaces and measures might indicate a way towards the envi- ronmental classification of organisms.
Certain biological phenomena, once defined, turn out to be robust concepts. To unravel and state them properly is a challenge. Guessing at cor- rect definitions and biological hypotheses requires mathematical thinking, and the screening of the various data configurations requires sophisticated rigour and a critical attitude. Claims are proven numerically, with an interlacing between statistics and combinatorics, and possibly without being
supported by biological hypotheses. Algorithms play a fundamental role in data analysis, and heu- ristic approaches and design of algorithms for fast, exhaustive searches bring us to face the theoretical limits of computational feasibility. The detection of biological signals by playing with computatio- nal processes is a challenge. The interplay between statistics and combinatorics needed to answer bio- logical questions, and which is strongly linked to an insightful understanding of evolution, should be developed. The way to do it is hard to see and will probably take many years.
Whether or not the interface between mathe- matics and molecular biology ever will cohabit with mathematics (and physics) at the institute, only time will say. At the moment, they might look worlds apart.
Alessandra Carbone

## 时间的问题

我在研究所试图调查数学和分子生物学之间的接口，这对我来说是一种新颖且不同的智力活动。当时我进行的数学基于没有数据，而数学-生物学则需要数学思维，其中的进展、方法和直觉在很大程度上依赖于对数据集的分析。定理被替换为对已知数据集上假设的数值验证，实际上，任何对进化和共同进化理解的进展似乎都无法通过纯理论思维来实现。在某些情况下，概率贡献被证明是基本的，例如Lander-Waterman基因组测序分析的情况。确定确保多种生物的基因组序列并行重建的条件问题仍然悬而未决，概率建模被要求澄清这些基本问题，这将导致对微生物及其环境的生物学有不同的理解。今天的基因组学正朝着将“环境”纳入其定义的方向发展，基于这一思路，智人通过其与数百万不同微生物的互动来理解他的环境。理解单细胞和多细胞生物及其环境构成了我们期望生物学在不久的将来的飞跃，适当空间和测量的数学形式化可能会指示出环境分类生物的一种方法。
某些生物现象，一旦定义，便成为稳健的概念。正确地解开并陈述它们是一个挑战。猜测正确的定义和生物假设需要数学思维，而筛选各种数据配置需要复杂的严谨性和批判态度。通过统计和组合之间的交错数值证明，可能不需要生物假设。算法在数据分析中起着根本作用，启发式方法和快速、全面搜索算法的设计使我们面临计算可行性的理论极限。通过运用计算过程检测生物信号是一个挑战。回答生物问题所需的统计和组合之间的相互作用，与对进化的深刻理解密切相关，应得到发展。如何做到这一点难以看清，可能需要很多年。
数学和分子生物学之间的接口是否会与研究所的数学（和物理学）共存，只有时间会告诉我们。目前，它们可能看起来是两个截然不同的世界。

## “The Times, They Are A-changing”

When I was writing my thesis at what was not yet called the Science Faculty of Orsay, there was a seminar there on harmonic analysis (originally the Kahane-Malliavin seminar) which the participants still remember with emotion and pleasure. One would meet there the top names of the world of “fine analysis”: Zygmund, Carleson, Rudin, Stein, Katznelson.... A passionate and cosmopolitan group of young people collected there, bringing their contributions. There was an air of adventure: each week brought its share of discoveries and strange problems. One nostalgic day, Yves Meyer, one of the bright lights of the seminar, confided in me, hyperbolically: “It was so fantastic that we should all have died at the end.”
In those happy days, it wouldn’t have occur-
red to us to cross the river to go to the monastery opposite which was the temple of a prestigious brotherhood: algebraic geometry and the disci-
ples of Grothendieck. The old-fashioned aspect of
“fine analysis” and the “entomological” approach
of mathematical beings would have been gently
mocked (fractals were not yet in fashion...).
At that time the geography of mathematics was interesting but a bit of a patchwork. The notion of laboratory or department in the Anglo-Saxon sense was still in limbo. Orsay was a pioneer in the matter. Often any collective ambition was thought suspect. Wasn’t that to encourage general medio- crity at the expense of individual excellence?
Ten or fifteen years later, the beautiful young people in mathematics had aged. In 1986, in France, half of university professors were between 40 and 47 years old. That year there were only six- teen senior lecturer posts available. Even the very modest place of mathematics in the CNRS was contested. In addition, as far as money was concer- ned, we were only allotted pencils and erasers. Thus France made only a miserly contribution to the international congress in Berkeley where our diplomatic corps was singularly absent.
We discovered that the world had changed and that we would have to be able to convince our contemporaries (as our American colleagues had done) that mathematics—all mathematics—is a “strategic resource for the future.” A cruel dilemma for a community more preoccupied by its theorems than by its economic and social role. I was privileged at the time to belong to a “band of pals”, fully aware of what was at stake, who had taken over the French Mathematical Society and urged me to become president to sound the wake-up call. The visionary of the gang was Jean-Pierre Bourguignon. I am sure I will offend his modesty by saying that, but too bad! His influence has not waned since, including on the European level.
In 1987 the colloquium “Mathématiques à Venir” held at the École Polytechnique precipita-
ted a change on the part of the decision-makers
in favour of mathematics, which up till then
had been absent from important scientific pro- grammes. There was also a realization in the community of the importance of a collective, European and planetary organisation of which
the IHES has today become one of the leading
lights, open to the plurality of mathematics. But
that is another story.
Jean-François Méla

## “时代在变化”

当我在尚未被称为奥赛科学学院的地方撰写论文时，那儿有一个关于调和分析的研讨会（最初是Kahane-Malliavin研讨会），参与者至今仍充满情感和愉悦地记得它。在那里可以遇到“精细分析”世界的顶尖人物：齐格蒙德、卡尔松、鲁丁、斯坦、卡茨内尔森......一群充满激情的年轻人聚集在那里，带来了他们的贡献。那里充满了冒险的气息：每周都有新的发现和奇怪的问题出现。某个怀旧的日子，研讨会的亮点之一伊夫·梅耶夸张地对我说：“它是如此美妙，我们都应该在最后死去。”
在那些快乐的日子里，我们不会想到要过河去对面的修道院，那是代数几何和格罗滕迪克弟子们的圣殿。“精细分析”的老派风格和数学存在的“昆虫学”方法会被温和地嘲笑（那时分形还不流行）。
那时数学的地理分布有趣但有点拼凑。英美意义上的实验室或系的概念仍在萌芽阶段。奥赛在这方面是先驱。集体雄心往往被认为是可疑的。那不是以牺牲个人卓越为代价鼓励普遍平庸吗？
十或十五年后，数学领域的那些美好青年已经老去。1986年，在法国，一半的大学教授年龄在40到47岁之间。那一年只有16个高级讲师职位。甚至在法国国家科学研究中心(CNRS)中，数学的地位也非常低。此外，就资金而言，我们只分到铅笔和橡皮擦。因此，法国在伯克利举行的国际大会上贡献甚微，我们的外交使团也显得特别缺席。
我们发现世界已经改变，我们必须像我们的美国同事那样，能够说服我们的同代人：数学——所有数学——是“未来的战略资源”。对于一个更关注其定理而非其经济和社会角色的社区来说，这是一个残酷的困境。当时，我有幸属于一个完全意识到利害关系的“伙伴团体”，他们接管了法国数学会，并敦促我成为会长以敲响警钟。这个团队的远见卓识者是让-皮埃尔·布尔吉尼翁。我确信这样说会冒犯他的谦逊，但没关系！他的影响力自那时起没有减弱，包括在欧洲层面。
1987年，在综合理工学院举行的“未来的数学”座谈会促使决策者转向支持数学，此前数学在重要科学项目中一直缺席。社区也意识到集体、欧洲和全球组织的重要性，如今高等科学研究所已成为这一组织的领先机构之一，开放数学的多样性。但那是另一个故事。

## The Vision

From Which This Book Has Arisen
There are no foggy mists as there are no algebras Which can resist, in the depths of numbers or skies, The calm deep gaze of eyes; I looked at this wall at first confused and vague Where everything seemed to float as on a wave Where all seemed vapor, vertigo, illusion, And beneath my pensive eye, the strange vision Became less misty and more clear As my eye was less troubled and more sure.

The discovery of this text by Victor Hugo which
opens the “Légende des Siècles” at first amazed
me; I found it so pertinent...to use imagery, cou-
ched in such superb language, to describe the activity of a mathematician embarking on a work
of some importance. Then surprise turned to a feeling of the obvious: any wide-reaching project
must stem from a preliminary outline, nurtured
by a “vision” that perseverance alone could turn
into a document worthy of being submitted to
the eyes of others. More than that: the author,
the unraveler, I would venture to say, after having
worked on his text over and over again, through dint of studying, acquires a conviction, a capa- city of expression, in a word a momentum he would never have imagined possessing. Isn’t this conquest through effort the most precious lesson that studying can give us?
However, there is no reason to limit this approach to the production of texts: it is also lar- gely relevant for many other human enterprises of any importance. Léon Motchane was also moved by a vision when, against all odds, he conceived and developed the IHES, an institution, which by its originality, was totally improbable in the France of the 1950s. He believed in its destiny, and certainly forced it at times, swept along by the inspiration which dissipates all illusions. The relay was taken up and the Institute continues its road, but it needs permanently to recreate its des- tiny: that is the law of exception, to have nothing to copy.
To come back to Hugo’s epic poem, couldn’t we dream of another outcome which would put mathematics at the heart of the “Légende des Siècles”? Nurtured by different cultures and trans- cending them, mathematics gives them a new dimension. Their adventure, constantly renewed, bounds on from challenge to challenge, whether they spring from its own territory or well up from exterior sources, brought to light by practitioners of other sciences, engineers, or simply curious scholars who, faced with an interrogation, are not satisfied with negligence.
Don’t let us cherish illusions. Even if a few giants like Old Hugo can claim consecration in the universal memory through their quest for beauty fulfilled and their dazzling conquest of a few certainties, we still have the exulting task of executing our work as craftsmen. We must make sure we have given ourselves the means to conti- nue the chain and transmit, to a few apprentices, the tricks we have patiently learned at times when our eyes, more sure, were no longer troubled.
Jean-Pierre Bourguignon

## 视野

本书由此而生

没有迷雾笼罩，亦没有任何代数难题可以抵抗，数学家在数字或天空的深处，以沉静的目光凝视。我初看这堵墙时，它模糊不清，一切仿佛在波浪上漂浮，一切似乎都是蒸汽、眩晕、幻象。但在我沉思的目光下，这奇异的景象变得不再朦胧而愈加清晰，随着我目光的坚定与平静。

发现维克多·雨果的这段文字，作为《世纪传说》的开篇，起初令我惊叹不已；我发现它如此贴切……用如此卓越的语言描绘数学家从事重要工作的情景。然后惊讶变成了一种显而易见的感觉：任何宏大的项目都必须源于一个初步的轮廓，由“视野”滋养，唯有毅力才能将其变成值得呈现给他人的文档。更重要的是，作者，解开谜题的人，我敢说，在经过反复研究他的文本后，通过不断的学习，获得了一种信念、一种表达能力，简而言之，是一种他从未想象过的动力。这种通过努力获得的成就难道不是学习能给我们的最宝贵的教训吗？

然而，没有理由将这种方法仅限于文本的创作：它同样适用于许多其他重要的人类事业。莱昂·莫查内在对抗所有困难的情况下，构思并发展了高等科学研究所，一个在1950年代的法国完全不可能出现的独特机构，他被一种视野所驱动，相信其命运，并在灵感的推动下消除了所有的幻象。接力棒被接过，研究所继续其道路，但它需要不断重塑其命运：这是例外的法则，没有任何东西可以复制。

回到雨果的史诗，我们能否梦想另一种结果，将数学置于《世纪传说》的核心？数学受不同文化的滋养并超越它们，赋予它们新的维度。其不断更新的冒险，从挑战到挑战，无论是来自其自身领域的挑战，还是由其他科学家、工程师或好奇学者提出的外部问题所激发，面对这些问题，不满足于粗心大意。

不要让我们怀有幻想。即使像雨果这样的一些巨人可以通过他们对美的追求和对某些确定性的辉煌征服而在普遍记忆中获得认可，我们仍然有兴奋的任务，像工匠一样执行我们的工作。我们必须确保我们具备继续这条链条并将我们在那些目光更坚定、更不迷茫的时候耐心学到的技巧传递给一些学徒的手段。
——让-皮埃尔·布尔吉尼翁

## Taming Mathematics

When a stranger asks me what I do, and I de- clare myself a mathematician, the reaction often betrays a certain anxiety (“math never was my thing”) but also some curiosity (“what kind of research does one do in math?”). Taming mathe- matics requires constantly renewed efforts, and at the beginning of a mathematician’s career it is certainly necessary for curiosity to overcome anxiety.

I remember my first contacts with mathe- matical research: the apprehension when faced with concepts that seemed forever out of reach, the frustration of not understanding. Curiosity pushing me to return unendingly to those semi- nars, starting each week with the ritual mantra “let X be a Calabi-Yau manifold” followed by incomprehensible and terrifying incantations.

Today, thanks to all those who have helped me to tame mathematics (they will recognize themselves), I am no longer afraid. I am now a true mathematician, and my talks also start with “let X be a Calabi-Yau manifold”. What follows this little sentence is undoubtedly terrifying for at least one person in the audience. But I hope
that for that person, my explanations will help
him or her to tame a tiny fragment of mathema-
tics. Not necessarily to understand it, but to be
less afraid, a necessary prelude to understanding and progress on the long road of mathematical knowledge.
Denis Auroux



## 驯服数学

当陌生人问我做什么工作时，我自称为数学家，反应往往会显露出某种焦虑（“数学从来不是我的强项”），但也有一些好奇（“数学研究什么呢？”）。驯服数学需要不断更新的努力，在数学家职业生涯的开始阶段，肯定需要好奇心战胜焦虑。

我记得我第一次接触数学研究时：面对似乎永远无法企及的概念时的忧虑，以及不理解的挫折感。好奇心驱使我不断回到那些研讨会，每周开始的仪式性咒语是“设X为一个卡拉比-丘流形”，接着是不懂且令人恐惧的咒语。

今天，感谢所有帮助我驯服数学的人（他们会认出自己），我不再害怕。我现在是真正的数学家，我的演讲也以“设X为一个卡拉比-丘流形”开头。接下来的内容对听众中的某个人来说无疑是令人恐惧的。但我希望对那个人来说，我的解释能帮助他或她驯服数学的一小部分。不一定是理解它，而是减少恐惧，这是理解和在漫长的数学知识道路上进步的必要前奏。

## Three Lights

Lunch

One day I had lunch with Shigefumi Mori, the
great Japanese mathematician. On no account
would I have missed the opportunity of talking
to him, but I wanted to avoid questions of mathe-
matics. After a little reflection or through reading,
I could always answer the questions myself. However, I deliberately chose to adopt the atti-
tude of a disciple, longing to ask the most general existential questions. And so, just before attacking
the raw fish, I asked him what advice he could
give me, in life or in mathematics.
And like in a Buddhist legend, the reply was
simple yet full of meaning: “One must do what
one profoundly desires to do.” It was crystal clear.
One does not learn: one convinces oneself of the
truth of what one has always known. The simplest
words are the most inspired.

The Unknown

There are few things more democratic than the unknown. Faced with the unknown, no judge- ment is better than any other; all are subjected to its implacable law. The unknown in science has a human dimension: you advance and the shadows disperse. It’s the “soft” version of the unknown. A far reach from the unknown of doctors and sol- diers who look death in the face, who meet the eyes of those who see death, the unbearable unk- nown. The unknown instigates the quest which in turn kills the unknown. The irrepressible need to know as if we were afraid of not knowing.

The Unforeseen

The unforeseen which paints life in vivid colours, opening the doors to new possibilities. Which gui- des our lives in as much as we allow it to. Ignorance of what will happen can bring about disappoint- ment: why are things not as we imagine them? Perhaps we don’t think enough, perhaps if we were diligent enough we could see in advance what will happen. Wisdom leans on the past, stretches to the future and unveils the unforeseen.

## 三盏灯

### 午餐

有一天，我与伟大的日本数学家森重文共进午餐。我绝不会错过与他交谈的机会，但我想避免数学问题。经过一点思考或阅读，我总是可以自己回答这些问题。然而，我故意选择了一个弟子的态度，渴望提出最一般的存在问题。所以，在吃生鱼片之前，我问他在生活或数学上能给我什么建议。

像佛教传说中的故事一样，回答简单而意义深远：“人必须做自己深切渴望做的事情。”这再清楚不过了。人们不是学习，而是说服自己相信一直以来所知道的真理。最简单的话语是最有灵感的。

### 未知

没有什么比未知更民主了。面对未知，任何判断都不优于其他；所有人都受其无情的法则约束。科学中的未知具有人的维度：你前进，阴影消散。这是“柔和”版本的未知。与医生和士兵面对死亡，直视死亡之眼，承受不可忍受的未知相去甚远。未知激发探索，探索杀死未知。无法抑制的求知欲仿佛我们害怕不知道。

### 意外

意外为生活增添了鲜艳的色彩，打开了新可能性的门。引导我们的生活，只要我们允许它的发生。对将来会发生什么的无知可能带来失望：为什么事情不像我们想象的那样？也许我们思考得不够，也许如果我们足够勤勉，我们可以提前预见将要发生的事情。智慧依靠过去，伸向未来，揭示意外。

## Beyond Numbers

Very often a mathematician considers his collea- gue from a different domain with disdain—what kind of a perverse joy can this guy find in his un- motivated and plainly boring subject? I’ve tried to learn the hidden beauty in various things, but still for many areas the source of interest is for me a complete mystery.

My theory is that too often people project their human weaknesses/properties onto their mathe- matical activity.
There are obvious examples on the surface: for instance, the idea of a classification of some objects is an incarnation of collector instincts, the search for maximal values is another form of greed, computability/decidability comes from the desire of a total control.

Fascination with iterations is similar to the hypnotism of rhythmic music. Of course, the classification of some kinds of objects could be very useful in the analysis of more complicated structures, or it could just be memorized in sim- ple cases.

The knowledge of the exact maximum or an upper bound of some quantity depending on parameters gives an idea about the range of its possible values. A theoretical computability can be in fact practical for computer experiments. Still, for me the motivation is mostly the desire to understand the hidden machinery in a striking concrete example, around which one can build formalisms.

If one tries to go further towards the “dehu- manization” of mathematics, a natural next step would be to consider the real numbers (which emanate from the basic properties of the physical world) as just another complicated non-alge- braically closed field.In some sense it is true; the complex numbers are much more beautiful.

But in another sense the real numbers are truly fundamental as they incarnate the idea of a bound, of a control of abstract algebraic structures. In a deep sense we are all geometers.

## 超越数字

数学家往往以轻蔑的眼光看待其他领域的同事——这些人怎么会在如此无趣的学科中找到乐趣呢？我试图了解各种事物中的隐藏美，但对于许多领域来说，兴趣的来源对我来说仍然是个谜。

我的理论是，人们太常将其人类弱点/特性投射到数学活动中。
有些显而易见的例子：例如，对某些对象进行分类的想法是收集者本能的体现，寻找最大值是另一种形式的贪婪，可计算性/可判定性源于对完全控制的渴望。

对迭代的迷恋类似于节奏音乐的催眠。当然，对某些种类的对象进行分类在分析更复杂的结构时可能非常有用，或者可以简单地记住一些简单的情况。

知道某个依赖于参数的量的确切最大值或上限可以让人了解其可能值的范围。理论上的可计算性实际上可以用于计算机实验。尽管如此，对我来说，动机主要是想了解一个引人注目的具体例子背后的隐藏机制，并以此为基础建立形式化。

如果试图进一步朝“非人性化”数学方向发展，自然的下一步是将实数（源自物理世界的基本属性）视为另一种复杂的非代数闭域。在某种意义上，这是真的；复数要美丽得多。

但在另一种意义上，实数真正是基础的，因为它们体现了对抽象代数结构的界限和控制的概念。从深层意义上说，我们都是几何学家。
