Statistical learning plays a key role in many areas of science, finance and industry. Here are some examples of learning problems: 
- Predict whether a patient, hospitalized due to a heart attack, will have a second heart attack. The prediction is to be based on demographic, diet and clinical measurements for that patient. 
- Predict the price of a stock in 6 months from now, on the basis of company performance measures and economic data. 
- Identify the numbers in a handwritten ZIP code, from a digitized image. 
- Estimate the amount of glucose in the blood of a diabetic person, from the infrared absorption spectrum of that personâ€™s blood. 
- Identify the risk factors for prostate cancer, based on clinical and demographic variables.

The science of learning plays a key role in the fields of statistics, data mining and artificial intelligence, intersecting with areas of engineering and other disciplines. This book is about learning from data. In a typical scenario, we have an outcome measurement, usually quantitative (such as a stock price) or categorical (such as heart attack/no heart attack), that we wish to predict based on a set of features (such as diet and clinical measurements). We have a training set of data, in which we observe the outcome and feature measurements for a set of objects (such as people). Using this data we build a prediction model, or learner, which will enable us to predict the outcome for new unseen objects. A good learner is one that accurately predicts such an outcome.
