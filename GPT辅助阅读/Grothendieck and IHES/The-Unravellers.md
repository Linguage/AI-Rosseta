## Mathematical Physics

Ivan Todorov
Bulgarian Academy of Sciences

My parents were philologists (and so is my bro- ther, Tzvetan), thus, as a child, I did not benefit from an early exposure to exact sciences. I inhe- rited instead an interest in the history of science and a taste for communication between science and humanities.

It has been always fascinating to discover the same mathematical law governing apparently different phenomena. Instances of Felix Klein’s pre-established harmony between mathematics (a game of pure thought) and natural phenomena seem even more impressive. The realization that numbers govern the sounds of music was a leading theme for Pythagoras and his school, the founders of mathematics as a science. Here is a more recent (and less popular) example of this type. After years of intensive study, following previous theoretical and experimental work of many physicists, Max Planck wrote in 1900 his formula for the energy distribution of black-body radiation that marked the beginning of quantum theory. Nobody seems to have noticed, however, that the small frequency (or high temperature) expansion of Planck’s formula gives rise to the
Bernoulli numbers. Jacob Bernoulli (1654–1705) introduced his numbers in the context of probability theory. In the 19th century they were related to modular forms that are basic to analytic number theory. The integral coefficients in the Fourier expansion of such forms, which play a prominent role in the context of number theory, appear as multiplicities in the interpretation of statistical mechanics.


我的父母是语言学家（我的兄弟 Tzvetan 也是），因此，在我童年时期，并没有受到对精确科学的早期接触的益处。相反，我继承了对科学历史的兴趣和对科学与人文学科之间交流的品味。

发现相同的数学规律似乎支配着不同的现象总是令人着迷的。菲利克斯·克莱因（Felix Klein）预先设定的数学与自然现象之间的和谐似乎更加令人印象深刻。认识到数字统治着音乐的声音是毕达哥拉斯及其学派、数学作为一门科学的奠基人的主题。这里是这种类型的一个更为近期（并不那么流行）的例子。在经过许多物理学家之前的理论和实验工作后，马克斯·普朗克于1900年写下了他的黑体辐射能量分布的公式，这标志着量子理论的开始。然而，似乎没有人注意到普朗克公式的小频率（或高温度）展开产生了伯努利数。雅各布·伯努利（1654–1705）在概率论的背景下引入了他的这些数。在19世纪，它们与模形式相关，模形式是解析数论的基础。在这些形式的傅立叶展开的整数系数在数论背景中发挥着重要作用，它们在统计力学的解释中作为多重性出现。

My young collaborator N. M. Nikolov and
I pointed out (in a paper completed during my
recent stay at the IHES, following a stimulating
discussion with Maxim Kontsevitch) that the
unique, normalized, modular form of weight
four reproduces Planck’s black-body energy
distribution in conformally compactified
space-time.


I also recall with pleasure a paper by Ya. Stanev
and myself, initiated at the IHES (benefiting from
the advice of another visitor, B. B. Venkov), in
which the Galois group for the roots of unity was
used to solve the Schwarz (finite monodromy)
problem for the Knizhnik-Zamolodchikov
equation, providing another link between
number theory and, this time, conformal field theory models.

我的年轻合作者 N. M. Nikolov 和我指出（在我最近在IHES逗留期间完成的一篇论文中，这是在与Maxim Kontsevitch进行了激动人心的讨论后），权重为四的唯一、标准化的模形在共形紧致化的时空中再现了普朗克的黑体能量分布。

我还愉快地回忆起与Ya. Stanev 合著的一篇论文，这篇论文是在IHES发起的（得益于另一位访客 B. B. Venkov 的建议），该论文使用了对于单位根的伽罗瓦群来解决 Schwarz（有限单值）问题，这为 Knizhnik-Zamolodchikov 方程提供了一个连接，进一步将数论与这次是共形场论模型联系在一起。

The legendary Alexandre Grothendieck (to whom the IHES owes much of its fame of the 1960s) explains in his “Recoltes et semailles” that a major stimulus for his abstract approach to algebraic geometry was the desire to find a common ground for the geometry of the continuum and the discrete «geometry of numbers». Alain Connes provides another unifying view of the discrete and the continuous—within noncommutative geometry. I vividly remember the series of seminar talks of Dirk Kreimer on his Hopf algebra approach to renormalization when the discussion (often continuing at lunch) revealed a close link with the Hopf algebra Connes and Moscovici had introduced, studying the transverse index theorem in non-commutative geometry. The visionary talk of Pierre Cartier at the 40th anniversary of the IHES, in which he dreamed of a unification of the ideas of Grothendieck, Connes-Kreimer and Kontsevitch, seems nowadays closer to reality than eight years ago.

传奇人物亚历山大·格罗滕迪克（IHES在1960年代的声誉很大程度上归功于他）在他的《收获与播种》中解释说，他对代数几何的抽象方法的主要刺激之一是希望找到连续几何和离散“数学几何”之间的共同基础。阿兰·孔涅为离散和连续提供了另一种统一的观点——在非交换几何中。我清楚地记得 Dirk Kreimer 就他的 Hopf 代数方法进行重整化的系列研讨会报告，讨论中（通常在午餐时继续）揭示了他的方法与 Connes 和 Moscovici 引入的 Hopf 代数之间的密切联系，他们研究了非交换几何中的横向指数定理。皮埃尔·卡尔蒂埃在IHES成立40周年时的富有远见的演讲中，他梦想着将格罗滕迪克、孔涅-克雷默和孔采维奇的思想统一起来，现在似乎比八年前更接近现实。

## In Praise of Tautology

Anna Wienhard
University of Chicago

 A rigorous, correct mathematical statement is true independent of the circumstances, so it is always a tautology. This might make it seem empty or boring.

Mathematical thinking is exploring and dis- covering the unknown tautology. Recovering the diversity, creating and finding inner structures of the tautological, which, when regarded from the outside, as a whole seems meaningless.
But it unfolds to a beautiful world in which many tautologies are waiting to be discovered and created, and structured to form a meaningful whole which will never be completed.

Anna Wienhard

严密、正确的数学陈述是独立于情境的真理，因此它始终是一个重言式。这可能使它看起来空洞或无聊。

数学思维是在探索和发现未知的重言式。恢复多样性，创造和发现重言式的内在结构，当从外部看时，整体似乎毫无意义。但它展开成一个美丽的世界，在这个世界中，有许多等待被发现、被创造和被构造成有意义整体的重言式，而这个过程永远不会完成。

## New Worlds

Giovanni Landi
University of Trieste

Rather that the opposite of false or fallacious, for Greeks truth is a-letheia (α-λήθηεια) namely what is un-veiled, revealed, not-ignored.

Continuously searching for minimal traces
that would allow us to open doors on new and splendid worlds that would be unveiled ‘enfin’,
we slowly move though concealed realms. And
the lucky travelers-seekers bring to light, unveil, fragments of ‘truth’, rewarded with instants of
pure, solitary joy.

与虚假或谬误相反，对于希腊人来说，真理是 a-letheia（α-λήθηεια），即揭示、显露、不被忽视的东西。

不断搜索能够让我们打开通向新世界的门的微小痕迹，终于揭示的东西，
我们缓慢地穿越隐藏的领域。而幸运的旅行者和探求者会揭示出“真理”的碎片，换来纯净、孤独的快乐瞬间。

## The Music Pavilion

Institute for Advanced Study, Princeton Fields Medal Crafoord Prize Wolf Prize
Pierre Deligne

The heart of the IHES was for me the construction with the big bay windows on the edge of the wood, a former music pavilion, with, at the time, a library on the left and a conference room on the right. There, every Tuesday afternoon took place the Bois-Marie seminar on algebraic geometry where Grothendieck edified the algebraic geometry which is now familiar to us.

Contrary to what I sometimes hear said, his
aim was not maximal generality. The ideal was
that theorems should be well understood, that
the structure of their proof should consist of
definitions, carefully chosen so that each geometric
idea should shed its light afar. A key word was
“dévissage,” or “unscrewing.”

I was stunned the day he proved the base change
theorem for a proper morphism $f：g^* Rf_* \stackrel{\sim}{\to} Rf^‘_* g^{'*}$
starting from the case of a constant sheaf on a
family of curves.

The lemmas followed one another, self-evident,
and, by the end of an hour, the heart of the theo-
rem was exposed.

That manner of proceeding has remained my ideal,
rarely attained: that nothing should remain visible of
the efforts it cost to reach an understanding.

Pierre Deligne


音乐亭

IHES 的核心对我而言是一座带有大玻璃窗户的建筑，位于树林边缘，曾经是一座音乐亭，当时左边是图书馆，右边是一个会议室。在那里，每周二下午都会举行 Bois-Marie 代数几何研讨会，Grothendieck 在那里建立了我们现在熟悉的代数几何。

与我有时听到的说法相反，他的目标不是追求最大的一般性。理想状态是定理应该被很好地理解，它们的证明结构应该由定义组成，这样每个几何思想都能在远处投下它的光芒。一个关键词是“dévissage”，或者“unscrewing”（拆解）。

有一天，他从一族曲线上的常数层的情况出发，证明了适合态射的基变换定理 $f：g^* Rf_* \stackrel{\sim}{\to} Rf^‘_* g^{'*}$ ，我感到很震惊。

引理一个接一个地出现，不证自明，一个小时结束时，定理的核心被揭示出来。

这种处理方式一直是我的理想，很少能够达到：让达成共识的过程中的努力不可见。

## Long Live the Whale

Claire Voisin
CNRS - IMJ - IHES CNRS Silver medal

The practice of mathematics ostensibly arouses cu- riosity, and yet mathematicians cannot talk about
their subject without provoking boredom or pain. Moreover, each one of us would be delighted to
do the honours of his area and help people to understand why a particular conjecture seems of capital importance to him. But expressions such
as “topological invariants” or “polynomial equa- tions”, “metric curvature” or “moduli spaces”
being censored, we can only take refuge in timo-
rous silence.

To break out of this silence I will attempt a
comparison. The picture which comes to my
mind is borrowed from the world of Moby Dick.
Like the watery element, mathematics is above
all coherent, even if the immensity of the subject
prevents contact between the most far-flung areas.
As in the marine world, the hidden part, the sub-
marine part, is infinitely more important than the
visible part. It is that which carries us, even if the
structures that it hides have not yet emerged, and
will only later on change their status to become
accessible to our understanding.

As for the mathematician, whether it be Ishmael, Ahab or Queequeg, he deciphers as far as he can that which is interpretable on the surface, yet keeps an eye open for the white whale (more or less impressive, according to his temperament or luck) which leads him to embark on these par- ticular waters.

Claire Voisin

数学实践表面上激发了好奇心，然而数学家们在谈论他们的主题时却不可避免地引起了无聊或痛苦。此外，我们每个人都会很高兴为他的领域做主持，并帮助人们理解为什么某个猜想对他来说至关重要。但是，由于“拓扑不变量”或“多项式方程”、“度量曲率”或“模空间”等表达方式被审查，我们只能退而求其次，保持胆怯的沉默。

为了打破这种沉默，我将尝试做一个比较。我脑海中浮现的画面借用自《白鲸记》的世界。与水元素一样，数学首先是一致的，即使主题的广大阻止了最遥远的领域之间的联系。就像海洋世界一样，隐藏的部分，水下的部分，远比可见的部分重要得多。正是它托起了我们，即使它隐藏的结构尚未显现，而将来只有在改变它们的地位以使它们变得可以理解之后才能让我们接触到。

至于数学家，无论是伊舍梅尔、艾哈布还是奎奎格，他都会尽其所能地解读表面上可解释的部分，但同时也会留心那条白鲸（根据他的性格或运气而更或更不令人印象深刻），这使他踏上这片特殊的水域。


## What Does One Write on It?

Jean-Marc Deshouillers
University of Bordeaux

A blackboard. Two men sitting silent throughout the scene; one nods his head, gets up, writes a for- mula on the board and sits down again; the other one frowns, gets up in his turn, goes to the board and modifies the formula.... Mathematicians— male or female—don’t recognise themselves in this caricature of their activity, of their communication, their social life. I take the opportunity here to pay tribute to the contemporary authors, directors, scenographers who represent mathe- matical activity more realistically and sometimes with great subtlety (I am thinking in particular of David Auburn and his play Proof, in French La Preuve). Not only are mathematicians not silent, but in addition, communication between them cannot be reduced to the exchange of “formulas”. However, if the blackboard is not an essential instrument in communication between mathematicians (you can “do maths” in a bus, while strolling along, during a meal...), it is neverthe- less an important element, present in conference rooms and offices.

What does one write on it?

Mathematical discourse is extremely codified;
besides, it is the formal aspect that the expres-
sion first evokes. It is its reason for being: the role
of formalism is (and should only be) to validate
the discourse. But the discourse is significant. As sophisticated as the form may be, it doesn’t create
meaning any more than the synthesis of molecules,
however complex, creates life. When mathemati-
cians talk to each other, they re communicating
about meaning; they are manipulating concepts,
exchanging mental representations. If this is com-
mon practice nowadays, I can remember, it was atthe end of the sixties, one of the greatest mathe- maticians who, when asked a delicate question, began by scribbling a tiny figure in a corner of the blackboard before quickly rubbing it out and serving up a totally formalized answer.

During the phase of creation, monologue or dia- logue, the blackboard transcends its role of tool of reflection and takes an active part in the creation: it reflects the graffito, inflects thought, corrobora- ting the remark of the poet, which I quote from memory: “What I write forces me to think that I was far from thinking that I was thinking”.

It is also in the phase of presentation, essentially oral, that the blackboard is an aid to discourse: one writes on it the articulations, it’s an aid to memory (the text remains on it often for more than half an hour). Filling it up gives the tempo of the talk. But above all the blackboard enables us to represent mental images: it is certainly this role of tracer, of revelator of the mathematical activity of creation which makes it an important element in mathematical iconography.

Will the blackboard be left aside in favour of
new technologies?The present craze for these tools suggests that possibility. And yet—even when
new technology is mastered—it cannot convey
the dimension of craftsmanship, the personal, physical, human dimension which the black-
board brings to mathematical discourse. Are we
at a crossroads where the blackboard is still our
wax tablet, with all the possibilities of immediate
and spontaneous representation of mathematical
art?

黑板。两个人默默地坐在场景中，其中一个点点头，站起来，在黑板上写下一个公式，然后再坐下；另一个皱着眉头，轮到他站起来，走到黑板前修改公式...数学家，无论男性还是女性，都无法在这种对他们的活动、交流和社交生活的讽刺中认出自己。我在这里借机向当代作者、导演和舞台设计师表示敬意，他们更真实地描绘数学活动，有时甚至非常微妙（我特别想到的是大卫·奥本及其剧本《证明》）。

数学家不仅不是沉默的，而且，他们之间的交流不能简化为“公式”的交换。然而，如果黑板不是数学家之间沟通的必要工具（你可以在公交车上、漫步中、用餐时“做数学”），它仍然是一个重要的元素，在会议室和办公室中都有。

在黑板上写什么呢？

数学话语极为规范化；此外，表达的第一印象是其形式方面。这是其存在的原因：形式主义的角色是（也应该只是）验证话语。但是话语是有意义的。形式可能再复杂，它不再创造意义，就像分子的综合，无论多么复杂，也不能创造生命一样。当数学家彼此交谈时，他们在交流有关意义的信息；他们操纵概念，交换心理表征。如果这是现代的常见做法，我记得在60年代末，有一位最伟大的数学家，在被问及一个微妙的问题时，开始在黑板的一个角落涂鸦一幅小图，然后迅速擦掉它，提供一个完全形式化的答案。

在创作阶段，无论是独白还是对话，黑板超越了它作为反思工具的角色，积极参与创作：它反映涂鸦，弯曲思维，证实了我从记忆中引用的诗人的话：“我写的东西迫使我思考，我远非认为我正在思考”。

在展示阶段，主要是口头的阶段，黑板是话语的一种辅助工具：人们在上面写下关节，它是记忆的辅助工具（文本经常停留在上面超过半个小时）。填写它给演讲定了节奏。但最重要的是，黑板使我们能够表示心理图像：正是这种描绘、揭示数学创作活动的角色，使其成为数学图像学中的重要元素。

黑板会被新技术取代吗？目前对这些工具的热衷表明了这种可能性。然而，即使掌握了新技术，它也不能传达黑板为数学话语带来的手工艺、个人、物理、人的维度。我们是否正处于一个十字路口，黑板仍然是我们的蜡板，具有即时和自发表示数学艺术的所有可能性？
